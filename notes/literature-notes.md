- defines the "assessment" and "procedural" paradigms around stock assessment
- notes that the assessment paradigm has proved challenging for data poor stocks in New Zealand; procedural paradigm holds promise
- also defines strategic versus tactical decision-making
- notes that similar arguments have been made before "(e.g., Stephenson and Lane 1995; de la Mare 1996, 1998; Stokes and Kell 1996; Lane and Stephenson 1998; Cooke 1999)"
- prefer the term "low information" over "data-poor"
- Nice management procedure definition: "A management procedure consists of an exactly specified set of data collection methods, analyses, and rules about what and when management actions should be taken in response to changes in fishery indicators."
- notes that MSE is similar to "operations research" in industrial engineering or "management science" in business (references listed in the paper)
- "evaluation overestimation, performance over standards, and robust and adaptive over precautionary" 

"We agree with Butterworth (2008) that observable performance measures should be preferred over those that are required to be calculated from simulations. Butterworth’s (2008) use of a quote from Dirac (1930) in relation to physics is so pertinent it bears repeating: ‘‘Variables not observable should not be introduced merely because they are required for the description of phenomena according to ordinary classical notation.’’ In fisheries, we are at risk of holding on to concepts from the assessment paradigm because they fit into ‘‘classical notation.’’ Biomass at maximum sustainable yield is a reference point rooted in the concept of maximizing long-term yield, but there may be simpler ways of measuring that management objective: by using average annual yield and the risk of fishery collapse as performance measures."

- the "data and time poverty in fisheries estimation" paper
- great reference for tier-based versus continuing based data limitations
- also focuses on strategic versus tactical estimation
- data poor methods are not an excuse to reduce data collection, analysis or modelling "to borrow a phrase from the child safety warnings on plastic bags: improper use could lead to suffocation"
