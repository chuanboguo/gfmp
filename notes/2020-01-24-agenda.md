# Meeting agenda

- Current status
   - Draft of most parts of working paper
   - Draft closed-loop simulation objectives/performance metrics
   - Draft operating models for rex sole (case study; shown), shortraker (case study; not shown yet)
   - Development of tools for getting our data into DLMtool formats, plotting oututs, defining operating models, generating CSAS reports

- Timeline
   - Review in April before inside yelloweye

- Working paper structure
   - Introduction
   - Best practices for an MP framework
   - The proposed framework
   - Case study summaries (Rex + Shortraker)
   - Discussion
      - Implicit knowledge of limit reference points
      - Strengths and weaknesses of various MP types
      - Format of the advice
      - Assessment frequency and triggers
      - Assessing value of information
      - Rebuilding
   - Appendices
      - Detailed MP descriptions
      - DLMtool OM description
      - MSEtool stock reduction analysis (SRA) description
      - DLMtool OM values that will provisionally not be used
      - Case study OMs + MSE results

- Current provisional performance metrics
   1. LT P40: Probability SB (spawning biomass) > 0.4 SB~MSY~ (years 36--50)
   2. LT P80: Probability SB > 0.8 SB~MSY~ (years 36--50)
   3. PNOF: Probability of not overfishing P(F < F/F~MSY~) (years 1--50)
   4. STY: Probability yield > 0.5 MSY (years 6--20)
   5. LTY: Probability yield > 0.5 MSY (years 36--50)
   6. AAVY: Probability that average annual variability in yield < 0.2 (years 1--50)

- Format of MSE outputs
   - See current figures ("Presentation of results and selection of management procedure")
   - Convergence checks
   - Projection timeseries (B/B~MSY~, F/F~MSY~, catches)
   - Performance metric probability table
   - Radar plots to illustrate performance metric trade-offs
   - Kobe B/B~MSY~ vs. F/F~MSY~ plots from final year
   - Kobe plots through time
   - Sensitivity of B/B~MSY~ and F/F~MSY~ in years 36--50 to OM parameter values
   - Sensitivity of B/B~MSY~ and F/F~MSY~ through time to high or low OM parameter values
   
- Case studies
   - One area for now?
   - Pre-1996 catch for Rex and Shortraker
   - Reference set
   - Other robustness set models for Rex
   - Commercial CPUE
   - Rex M

- Governance
   - How many more meetings?
   - What to be reviewed before main meeting? (e.g., Shortraker?)

<!--
* General layout of the Framework (best practice steps)
* Objectives
* Performance Metrics
* Plots for decision-making
* Case study species (too late to change them anyway but still need a nod)
* General OM features
* Ceq assumption for Rex base model (Paul or Rowan might be able to help or at least mobilise Brian)

*Acronyms: MP: management procedure; OM: operating model; DLMtool and MSEtool: R packages for data-limited management strategy evaluation; SRA: stock reduction analysis*
