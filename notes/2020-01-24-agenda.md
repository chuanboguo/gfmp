# Meeting objectives

Ensure everyone has an up-to-date understanding of the current status of the project and plans going forward.

Get feedback on draft working paper structure, performance metrics, case study selection, format of advice, etc.

...

*Acronyms: MP: management procedure; OM: operating model; DLMtool and MSEtool: R packages for data-limited management strategy evaluation; SRA: stock reduction analysis*

# Meeting agenda

- Current status
   - Draft of most parts of working paper
   - Draft closed-loop simulation objectives/performance metrics
   - Draft operating models for rex sole (case study; shown), shortraker (case study; not shown yet)
   - Development of tools for getting our data into DLMtool formats, plotting oututs, defining operating models, generating CSAS reports

- Timeline
   - Review in April before inside yelloweye

<!--TODO revise:-->
- Working paper structure
   - Introduction
   - Best practices for an MP framework
   - The proposed framework
   - Case study summaries (Rex + Shortraker)
   - Discussion
      - Implicit knowledge of limit reference points
      - Strengths and weaknesses of various MP types
      - Format of the advice
      - Assessment frequency and triggers
      - Assessing value of information
      - Rebuilding
   - Detailed MP descriptions
   - DLMtool OM description
   - MSEtool stock reduction analysis (SRA) description
   - DLMtool OM values that will provisionally not be used
   - Case study OMs + MSE results

- Current provisional performance metrics:
   1. LT P40: Probability SB (spawning biomass) > 0.4 SB~MSY~ (years 36--50)
   2. LT P80: Probability SB > 0.8 SB~MSY~ (years 36--50)
   3. PNOF: Probability of not overfishing P(F < F/F~MSY~) (years 1--50)
   4. STY: Probability yield > 0.5 MSY (years 6--20)
   5. LTY: Probability yield > 0.5 MSY (years 36--50)
   6. AAVY: Probability that average annual variability in yield < 0.2 (years 1--50)
   
- Case studies
   - Rex Sole:
      - No aging data (but many otoliths) and tight survey CVs
      - No TAC
   - Shortraker Rockfish:
      - Dodgy aging data
      - Wide survey CVs (infrequently encountered)
      - Has TAC and an outstanding request for advice
      - Major catch uncertainty pre-1997
      
- Stock production analysis (SRA) conditioning
   - Catch equilibrium assumption
   ...

- Format of MSE outputs
   - See current figures ("Presentation of results and selection of management procedure")
   - Convergence checks
   - Projection timeseries (B/B~MSY~, F/F~MSY~, catches)
   - Performance metric probability table
   - Radar plots to illustrate performance metric trade-offs
   - Kobe B/B~MSY~ vs. F/F~MSY~ plots from final year
   - Kobe plots through time
   - Sensitivity of B/B~MSY~ and F/F~MSY~ in years 36--50 to OM parameter values
   - Sensitivity of B/B~MSY~ and F/F~MSY~ through time to high or low OM parameter values
   
- Application to multiple spatial regions
   - Most MPs work with a single index
   - Simplest to work with spatial regions linked to a single survey
   - Case studies are with a single region
   - Suggesting multiple OMs or stitching surveys (not dealt with in this report)

- Format of advice and updates
   - Initially as a Research Document
   - Potentially for small groups of related species to be assessed together
   - Science Responses to update MP recommendations, possible for multiple species at once
   - Revisit OM on schedule or based on other indication

<!--
* General layout of the Framework (best practice steps)
* Objectives
* Performance Metrics
* Plots for decision-making
* Case study species (too late to change them anyway but still need a nod)
* General OM features
* Ceq assumption for Rex base model (Paul or Rowan might be able to help or at least mobilise Brian)
