*Re: Proceedings of the Pacific regional peer review on A Review of International Best Practices to Assigning Species to Tiers for the Purposes of Stock Assessment Based on Data Availability and Richness.*

- tier placement reviewed by committee each year in Alaska 

- main tiered approach goal for DFO is "to work more efficiently and deliver more stock assessments"

goals:
- comply with Precautionary Approach
- provide biomass estimates and uncertainty with respect to Precautionary Approach reference points (0.8 Bmsy, 0.4 Bmsy; upper stock reference and limit reference points)
- provide catch advice for all species with a TAC

- risk of overfishing should not increase if data-limited methods are used 

- uncertainty can be accounted for by adding buffer or through simulation testing 

- uncertainty buffers are used in Alaska, ICES, Australia 

- data "reliability" can rely on application or assessment method used (e.g. survey might be useful especially but not in temporal trend of productivity)

- proposed to test consistency produced by each tier using real or simulated data (e.g. Pacific ocean perch)
- has been unsatisfying in the United States, don't know true status and results highly variable across stocks 

- unclear if a tiered approach framework would include stock assessment prioritization 

- participants of workshop agreed to retain the 5 tiers as a communication tool regardless of simulation approach 

- mseR (SFU) currently most appropriate for tiers 1 and 2 (data-rich) (or ss3sim?)

- "In essence, the TA framework should communicate to managers what assessment methods are most appropriate for any given species given data availability and quality; and from those assessment methods what kind of advice is possible."

- suggestion to tie assessment frequency to tier level 

- Alaska uses a formalized 12-factor scorecard for prioritization that covers fishery concerns, stock health, ecosystem role, and management concerns; suggestion made that this will be useful for BC groundfish 

- tier status would need to be reviewed periodically; EU uses a five-year cycle, Alaska reviews annually 

- tier status review would need to be a CSAP process 

- general goal of any tier approach is that "as data become less abundant, advice should become more precautionary"

- "percentage reductions", "uncertainty caps"

- agreed that data-limited advice should be more precautionary and there should be no incentive to move to a more data-limited tier

- proposed tiers at least for communication purposes: data-rich (statistical catch-at-age models), data-moderate (delay-difference or surplus production models), data-limited (survey indices?), data-poor (catch-only models), data-less (life history, ...) (amalgamate last 3 for analysis and simulations)

- endorsement for development of a technical working group (TWG) to complete decision tree, develop management objectives, develop performance metrics, develop simulation exercises, contribute to 2nd CSAS working paper 

- need to decide on process by which species moves up or down tiers
