"use of HCRs without an evaluation to determine the extent to which they achieve their goals, given the uncertainty inherent in the system being managed, cannot guarantee that they will be precautionary in practice, even though they may contain elements intended to make them precautionary (Kirkwood and Smith, 1996; Punt 2006)"

"A management procedure is a simulation-tested set of rules used to determine management actions, in which the data, the methods for analysing the data (including any method of stock assessment) as well as the HCR are pre-agreed and pre-specified (Butterworth et al., 1997)"

"Peterman (2004) compares operating models with flight simulators: “the latter include detailed dynamic feedback processes to help pilots determine which decision-making protocols are best in the presence of a wide range of possible, but uncertain, simulated contingencies”."

Types of error (Kell et al. 2006a): process, observation, estimation, model, implementation

management procedures based on an underlying stock assessment model tend to be less variable in catch limits than those based only on measurable quantities like survey estimates

The review where management strategy evaluation frameworks are used around the world:

IWC (pioneered the use of management procedures, first used in de la Mare 1986)

South africa (earliest examples of management strategy evaluation frameworks for Marine fisheries, citations included; they include a reference set of operating models)

One of the biggest benefits of management strategy evaluation framework is the byproduct of making people think about long-term resource use rather than focusing on next years limits , identifying and quantifying  management objectives, assessing the impact of various sources of uncertainty

subscribes to the multiple working hypotheses framework

management procedures effectively run on "auto-pilot"

"Schnute et al. (2007) describe MSE as “the dominant issue in the future of fisheries stock assessment”."

"The MSE framework has proved a powerful tool for developing management strategies (or procedures) that are robust to uncertainty, able to meet multiple management objectives, and compatible with the precautionary approach (FAO, 1996)."
