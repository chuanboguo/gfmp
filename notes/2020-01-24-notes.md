Emphasize that reference points are integral to the MP framework; it's just that they are not necessarily explicitly known.

Make sure to include plots of the future (and historical) index projections.

For rockfish stocks, may consider episodic recruitment events among alternative OMs.

Should probably report on average catch during some near-term window for various MPs, although doesn't have to be part of the performance metric plots.

Average annual variability performance metric threshold could be based on historical variability for that fishery.

Mention the already coded COSEWIC performance metrics, which could be used in some cases.

Discuss and document process of moving out of this data-limited framework and the thought process behind what stocks would go through the framework; to some extent this is going to have to happen on a stock-by-stock basis

Provisional time windows for long-term conservation performance metrics should probably be based on generations with some consideration for using the short end of possible windows for very long-lived rockfish.

Shorten short-term yield window, something like years 6-10 or even shorter. Could even include the phase-in window starting at year 1 or 2.

Consider performance metric based on the phase-in period; look at sablefish.

Given a more neartime short-term yield window, consider including a medium term yield metric.

It was proposed that we could allow for an initial delay in implementing the MP. Decided that the MPs could likely be implemented quickly enough that this wouldn't be a necessary step.

Decide on terminology of a yield vs. catch.

Make sure the reference MPs are distinguished from the candidate MPs in various figures (e.g., in the projection plots).

On the spectrum of generic (efficient) vs. fully tailored (less-efficient), likely makes sense to start with more fully tailored approaches and then over time patterns will emerge and assessments can be conducted in similar ways.

If decreasing the number of candidate MPs, focus on MPs that present considerable contrast in their performance.

Settle on spider, vs. radar, vs. kite plot terminology throughout.

Describe the dashed lines in the spider plots (reference MPs; or switch them to thinner lines).

If we keep the sensitivity dot plots, switch the parameter names to be human readable versions (not DLMtool arguments).

Considering smaller ranges of parameter uncertainty in different scenario OMs may be more transparent than large parameter uncertainty ranges with fewer OMs.

Potentially remove the M decreasing scenario. Provide some ecological rationale for the increasing M scenario (e.g. climate change) and emphasize that it is mostly in the case study here as a demonstration of robustness scenarios.

Mention co-caught species in the species background section---may be helpful for borrowing life-history and fishery information.

For shortraker, consider rolling up the fishing events to trips for CPUE analysis.

Rock Sole and maybe Petrale Sole may provide some information on how often Rex is caught as a co-occuring species for historical context.

Note that Rex are often referred to as "witches".
