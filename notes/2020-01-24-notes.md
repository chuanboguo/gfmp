# Meeting notes

## General comments on the proposed MP Framework

### Improving communication

The meeting began with some general comments on the framework and suggestions to improve communication about the details of the framework and improvements to the framework itself.

It is important to communicate clearly that reference points are integral to the MP framework, even if they are not explicitly known. The Precautionary Approach (PA) Framework and the new [Fish Stocks Provisions](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/f-14/page-3.html#h-1175547) of the Fisheries Act are clear that fish stocks in Canada should be managed so they are maintained at or rebuilt to above the Limit Reference Point (LRP). For data-limited stocks when it is not possible to estimate reference points, it will be necessary to develop decision-making processes that preserve the intent of the PA Framework and Fish Stocks Provisions, i.e., the MP Framework is designed to provide the science to support selection of management procedures (MPs) that provide a high probability of maintaining stocks above the LRP. 

There have been some concerns among stakeholders that the Framework could be too "generic". There was discussion of the trade-off between detailed customization of OMs vs more generic OMs to increase efficiency. So far the authors have worked on customized OMs for the two case study species, Rex Sole (*Glyptocephalus zachirus*) and Shortraker Rockfish (*Sebastes borealis*). OMs are fit to available indices of abundance (and any other available data) and conditioned on catch data using an age-structured model implemented in the companion package to DLMtool, MSEtool. It was suggested that the MP Framework start by focusing on customized models rather than generic in its first applications. This could help managers and stakeholders with understanding and acceptance of the Framework. Over time, with familiarity, patterns may emerge and assessments could be conducted in similar ways.

There was also a recommendation to discuss and document process of how species would be selected for data-limited assessment via the MP Framework and how a species could be moved out of the Framework. While the availability of quality age-composition data would be the first consideration, this will likely need to be done on a stock-by-stock basis, and in consultation with science, managers, stakeholders and other interested parties. 

Currently there may be an assumption among stakeholders that advice from the MP Framework is of a lower quality than a full stock assessment. This is not necessarily the case, as the OMs themselves are calibrated to observed data and are essentially stock assessments, even though they are limited by lack of data. For this reason, the authors recommend developing multiple OMs to include the major axes of uncertainty. The main difference between an MP Framework (or Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE) approach) and a conventional stock assessment is where the risk is evaluated. In MSE, decisions on risk metrics are built into the objectives and performance metrics, with uncertainty incorporated in the OMs. In a conventional stock assessment, decisions on risk are dealt with at the end via decision tables or similar. The authors agreed to improve documentation of what the products of the MP Framework are and how they can be used.

There was a recommendation (from participants in the meeting and in comments sent prior to the meeting) to include discussion in the working paper of how alternative OMs would be treated in the management recommendations, for example, how would a decision proceed if an MP performs well (has acceptable trade-offs) under the reference set of OMs but performs poorly under the robustness OMs. Similarly, does performance under a worst-case OM scenario determine whether an MP is included as a management option? This would require some consideration of whether decision-making is risk-averse or risk-neutral and will require input from managers, stakeholders and other interested parties.

There was discussion and agreement from the authors to include a section of recommendations for the implementation stage of the Framework, once an MP has been selected. Authors agreed that it will be important to monitor and compare OM projection results with future observations (i.e., survey indices) and determine when an OM re-evaluation should be triggered. For example when observed indices fall outside the CV of the predicted index beyond some agreed threshold. Recommending triggers for re-assessment is a CSAS requirement of most stock assessments and is included in the Terms of Reference for the first application of the Framework for Inside Yelloweye Rockfish, due for CSAS review immediately after the MP Framework CSAS review.

### Discussion of projection period

A discussion on the ability to project forward 50 (or more) years, especially for species like rockfishes, led to suggestions to improve operating models (OMs) for rockfish species by allowing for episodic recruitment events in the projection years. This could be achieved using a "fat-tailed" probability distribution for recruitment deviations in the projections in one or more OMs, to investigate the impacts of episodic recruitment on performance of MPs.

There were several discussions related to the time periods for the projections.There is a question of whether to select short-term and long-term periods for performance metrics based on number of years or on fractions/multipliers of generation time. There was a suggestion that the projection period be determined on a stock-by-stock basis, with the length of the projection period identified as a decision point during initial development of the OMs for individual stocks.

In the current proposed Framework, the authors used a 50-year projection period for the Rex Sole case study. However, provisional time windows for long-term conservation performance metrics should probably be based on some multiple of generation-time, with some consideration for using shorter possible windows (e.g., 1.5 generation time) for very long-lived rockfish species. 

There was a discussion about how to deal with the "burn-in" or "phase-in" period at the very beginning of the projection period when the MP is applied for the first time, both in the simulations and in real applications of the MP. Perhaps there should be a "slow-up/fast-down" approach, or perhaps maintain status quo catches for a period at the beginning. This is not a decision for Science, although science could support the discussion through alternative simulations. It was noted that several of the MPs already have smoothers built into them. mseR has a buffering parameter to smooth the transition of catches between years. The Sablefish MSE and ICES MSE process may also be useful to consult for precedence on dealing with phasing in MPs.

### Objectives and Performance Metrics

Related to the above phase-in discussion, there was a comment that there could be an additional objective related to the transition between current management recommendations and the 'best' MP, to provide some measure of stability for industry.

There was a suggestion to look at shorter-term conservation metrics (e.g., one generation time or shorter) to make sure MPs aren't initially crashing the stock before a slow recovery. These could be used as secondary performance metrics for diagnostic purposes. In general, metrics may be needed to capture dynamics early in the projection period.

There were comments that the authors' choice of a 20-year short-term period for yield-based performance metrics is not really short-term from a harvester's perspective. Six-ten years may be more appropriate for the definition of short-term.

Related to this, there was a discussion of whether the short-term yield (STY) and long-term yield (LTY) metrics should be relative to MSY or some agreed-upon average catch level.

The average annual variability in yield (AAVY) performance metric threshold could be based on historical variability for that fishery, i.e., be determined on a stock-by-stock basis. In general it was noted that many data-limited stocks will be incidentally-caught species, and therefore AAVY may be a less important metric for these stocks than for target stocks. Of more interest could be species that may act as choke species if the TAC for them is too low. For these species AAVY may indicate periods of low TAC, which could cause problems accessing target species. The authors agreed and also noted that AAVY is a useful diagnostic of model behaviour (high AAVY may indicate MPs that are frequently closing the fishery), which could be masked by metrics such as average catch. 

Given there is some minimum catch required for multispecies fisheries to operate, it may be important to include a catch floor in MPs, on a stock-by-stock basis. Industry could provide this number for the case study stocks.

Consider switching (or adding) yield performance metrics based on probability of exceeding some lower required threshold for maintaining the multispecies fisheries. Could be based on some historical number in some cases.

Mention the already coded COSEWIC performance metrics, which could be used in some cases.


Consider performance metric based on the phase-in period; look at sablefish.

Given a more near-term short-term yield window, consider including a medium term yield metric.

Should probably report on absolute average catch during some near-term window for various MPs, although doesn't have to be part of the performance metric plots.




## Operating Model

Make sure to include plots of the future (and historical) index projections.

Considering smaller ranges of parameter uncertainty in different scenario OMs may be more transparent than large parameter uncertainty ranges with fewer OMs.

## Management Procedures


It was proposed that we could allow for an initial delay in implementing the MP. Decided that the MPs could likely be implemented quickly enough that this wouldn't be a necessary step.

Make sure the reference MPs are distinguished from the candidate MPs in various figures (e.g., in the projection plots).

If decreasing the number of candidate MPs, focus on MPs that present considerable contrast in their performance.

Will visually denote satisficed and reference MPs on probability table/figure.


If we keep the sensitivity dot plots, switch the parameter names to be human readable versions (not DLMtool arguments).


## Case Studies

Mention co-caught species in the species background section---may be helpful for borrowing life-history and fishery information.

### Rex Sole
Note that Rex are often referred to as "witches".

Rock Sole and maybe Petrale Sole may provide some information on how often Rex is caught as a co-occurring species for historical context.

Potentially remove the M decreasing scenario. Provide some ecological rationale for the increasing M scenario (e.g. climate change) and emphasize that it is mostly in the case study here as a demonstration of robustness scenarios.


### Shortraker Rockfish

For Shortraker, consider rolling up the fishing events to trips for CPUE analysis.

## Agreed edits to the working paper

Participants made several useful suggestions to clarify the framework and improve the working paper. The authors agreed to:


* Standardize terminology for spider/radar/kite plots throughout.

* Standardize terminology for catch vs yield ... arguments were made in favour of both. Catch is a more accessible term. yield is consistent with terminology such as MSY, *F*~MSY~ and *B*~MSY~.

* Describe the dashed grey lines in the spider plots (these are reference MPs) or switch them to thinner grey lines.
