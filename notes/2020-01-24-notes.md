Emphasize that reference points are integral to the manager procedure framework, it's just that they are not necessarily explicitly known

Make sure to include plots of the future (and historical) index projections

For rock fish species, may consider episodic recruitment events as an operating model

Should probably report on average catch during some near-term window for various MPs, although doesn't have to be part of the performance metric plots

Average annual variability performance metric threshold could be based on historical variability for that fishery

At least mention the already coded COSEWIC performance metrics, which could be used in some cases

Discuss and document about moving out of data-limited scenario and the thought process behind what stocks would go through the framework; to some extent this is going to have to happen on a stock by stock basis

Provisional time windows for long-term conservation performance metrics should probably be based on generations with some consideration for using the short end of possible windows for very long-lived rockfish

Shorten short-term yield window, something like years 6-10 or even shorter. Could even include the phase-in window.

Consider performance metric based on the phase-in period; look at sablefish

Given a more near-term short-term yield window, consider including a medium term yield metric

I was proposed that we could allow for an initial delay in implementing the MP. Decided that the MPs could likely be implemented quickly enough that this wouldn't be a necessary step.

Decide on terminology of a yield vs. catch

Make sure the reference MPs are distinguished from the candidate MPs in various figures (e.g., in the projection plots)

On the spectrum of generic (efficient) vs. fully tailored (less-efficient), likely make sense to start with more fully tailored approaches and then over time patterns will emerge and assessment can be conducted in similar ways

If decreasing the number of candidate MPs, focus on MPs the present considerable contrast in their performance

Settle on spider, vs. radar, vs. kite plot terminology throughout

Describe the dashed lines in the spider plots (reference MPs; or switch them to thinner lines)

If we keep the sensitivity dot plots, switch the parameter names to be human readable versions (not DLMtool arguments)

Considering smaller ranges of parameter uncertainty in different scenario OMs may be more transparent than large parameter uncertainty ranges with fewer OMs

Potentially remove the M decreasing scenario

Provide some ecological rationale for the M scenario and emphasize that it is mostly in the case study here as a demonstration of robustness scenarios

Mention co-caught species in the species background section --- may be helpful for borrowing life history information and fishery information

For shortraker, consider rolling up the fishing events to trips before CPUE analysis

Rock Sole and maybe Petrale Sole may provide some information how often Rex is caught as a co-occuring species for historical context

Note that Rex are often referred to as "witches"
