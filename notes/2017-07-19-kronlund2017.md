*Re: Management Strategy Evaluation: Considerations for Application to Canadian Fisheries. A.R. Kronlund and P.A. Shelton.*

Nice definition of MSE "Management strategy evaluation is a structured decision-making approach to agreeing on the steps needed to satisfy objectives for a fish stock and the fisheries that harvest the stock."

Management procedure includes: "stock and fishery monitoring data collection, stock assessment method, and a harvest control rule that translates assessment method outputs into predefined management actions"

Provides a nice list of requirements of management strategy evaluation on page 3.

They emphasized that management choice under MSE is not, for example, an effort limit. It's the aggregate of data, assessment method and harvest control rule that provides a means of calculating the effort, for example. 

MSE "differs from the traditional stock assessment approach because, under a management-oriented paradigm, scientific activities are focused on the uncertainties and processes that directly affect management outcomes rather than trying to make assessment models more "real" or searching for better statistical fits to data by adding complexity"

"Each OM acts as an "omniscient accountant" of its true world"

"These simulated data should have a high expectation of actually being available in the future..."

"Testing MP performance against simulated data for a range of OMs in (1) means the accepted MPs are robust to uncertainties that arise from imperfect knowledge of the biological and fishery system."

"Admitting a range of uncertainties as required by (1) means, in effect, that no one set of biological reference points can be said to be correct for a given stock. This impacts the interpretation of the DFO PA Framework which currently implies there is a single set of biological reference points."

A fully specified objective must have:

1. an outcome of interest (for example, a limit to be avoided or a target to be)

2. a desired probability of achieving that outcome 

3. a timeframe to measure performance

Biological reference points (BRP) categorized as a limits or targets 

Limit reference points (LRP): fish stock states to be avoided such as a minimum level of biomass

Target reference points (TRP): desirable states of a stock

Occupational Control Points (OCP): perceived states at which management actions take place

"a well-designed HCR can compensate to some extent for bias, uncertainty, and lag effects in the stock assessment model (Cooke 1999; de la Mare 1998)."

Benefits include defensible fishing plans, operational stability, ...

"One of the most significant advantages of MSE is that it demonstrates due diligence that a management system has a reasonable expectation of meeting the agreed-upon conservation and yield objectives."

Challenges include:

- development time 
- stakeholder management confidence in a complicated procedure 
- lack of stakeholder by and if consultation inadequate 
- difficulty selecting the reference set of operating models and possibly waiting various scenarios 
- insufficient inclusion of uncertainty in operating model
- perceived lack of flexibility

Management strategy evaluation with DFO has usually been initiated by fishing industry
