# GFMP Research Document Outline

# Introduction (mostly existing draft)

* Motivation
* The tiered approach
* Movement towards management procedure approaches
* The model-oriented approach versus the management-oriented approach (not yet drafted)
* The objectives of this project
* The expected benefits of this project

# Best practices for setting up a management procedure approach from the literature

*draw on Punt et al. 2016 and/or Rob's work and/or herring roadmap?*
*Briefly list suggested steps, for example (from herring roadmap for now)*

* Define decision context
* Define specific objectives and performance indicators
* Identify management procedure options
* Define a set of operating models that capture main uncertainties
* Simulate and compute performance indicators
* Rank overall mp performance
* Apply the mp to real fishery

# How the proposed approach goes about adopting those best practices

* Define decision context
    - clarify the exact decision, decide on the timeframe, decide on the boundaries of the project, decide on collaborative roles, clarify how final decision will be made
    - give examples throughout

* Define specific objectives and performance indicator
    - suggested starting points for objectives and performance indicators across most stocks this will apply to

* Identify management procedure options
    - summarize candidates that we have narrowed it down to
    - reference the detailed appendix

* Define a set of operating models that capture main uncertainties
    - what are the common main uncertainties that we should make sure to capture
    - defining robustness sets
    - consider weights based on relative plausibility

* Simulate and compute performance indicators
    - software (DLMtool)
    	- why using it
    	- what it can do
    	- note that the approach is software agnostic
    	- examples of where it has been used
    - checking for convergence of MP selection

* Rank overall MP performanc
    - suggested figures and table
    - satisficing

* Apply the MP to real fishery
    - MP needs to be followed exactly as defined to meet desired objectives
    - if adjustments need to be made, suggests a need to revisit the objectives

# Summarize the case studies

# Discussion or some other title

## Implicit versus explicit knowledge of limit reference points

* How this can still fit into the precautionary framework, sustainable fisheries framework and bill C68
* Not just a backup solution, could be argued that this is a better solution then the usual "explicit" knowledge

## Suggested format of the advice

* Suggested elements to include in a research document
* Suggested elements to include in a SAR
* Potential use of SRs to update advice
* Potential to assess multiple related species simultaneously

## Suggested reassessment frequency

## Suggestions for establishing triggers for reassessment

* Identifying mismatches between the operating model and realized data

## Suggestions for including environmental effects

* Tie into bill C68 and ecosystem approach to fisheries management working group
* Perhaps one of the most feasible ways to include environmental effects is via operating models

## Suggestions for using the approach to determine the value of information

* Possibly draw on the value of aging data for English sole from a case study as an example

## Suggestions for use in rebuilding plans

* Brief overview
* Note the upcoming yelloweye inside application

# Appendix: Candidate management procedures

* How we picked them
* Document them
* Give examples of where they have been used

# Appendix: A summary of the important features of the DLMtool operating model

# Appendix: Case study towards the more data limited spectrum (shortraker rockfish)

# Appendix: Case study towards more data rich/moderate spectrum (English sole?)

# Appendix: a mocked up SAR based on one of the case studies?
