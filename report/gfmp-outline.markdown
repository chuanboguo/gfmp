# GFMP Research Document Outline

# Introduction

*(mostly existing draft)*

* Motivation
* The "tiered approach"
* Movement towards management-procedure (MP) approaches
* The model-oriented approach versus the MP approach (not yet drafted)
* The objectives of this document
* The expected benefits of this approach

# Best practices for implementing an MP approach

*Draw on Punt et al. 2016 and/or Kronlund and Shelton Discussion Paper, and/or Herring roadmap?*
*Briefly list suggested steps, for example: (from herring roadmap for now)*

* Define decision context
* Define specific objectives and performance indicators
* Identify management procedure options
* Define a set of operating models that capture main uncertainties
* Simulate and compute performance indicators
* Rank overall MP performance
* Apply the MP to real fishery

# How the proposed approach adopts these best practices

* Define decision context
    - clarify the exact decision, decide on the timeframe, decide on the boundaries of the project, decide on collaborative roles, clarify how final decision will be made
    - give examples throughout including what we propose as starting points

* Define specific objectives and performance indicator
    - suggested starting points for objectives and performance indicators across most stocks this will apply to
    - justify these objectives and performance indicators based on PA framework, literature, and precedent in Canada and elsewhere

* Identify management procedure options
    - summarize candidates that we have narrowed it down to
    - reference the detailed appendix

* Define a set of operating models that capture main uncertainties
    - what are the common main uncertainties that we should make sure to capture
    - what are potential sources of uncertainty that by default we suggest should not be focused on (but could be included on a stock by stock basis)
    - the idea behind robustness sets; example robustness sets
    - consider weights based on relative plausibility (and why by default we suggest avoiding this complexity)

* Simulate and compute performance indicators
    - proposed software (DLMtool)
    	- why use it?
    	- what it can do?
    	- note that the approach is software agnostic
    	- examples of where it has been used
    - how many iterations: checking for convergence of MP selection

* Rank overall MP performance
    - suggested figures and table
    - explain satisficing
    - describe potential default satisficing rules

* Apply the MP to real fishery
    - same MP; real data
    - reinforce that MP needs to be followed exactly as defined to meet desired objectives
    - if adjustments need to be made this suggests a need to revisit the objectives

# Summary of case study 1

# Summary of case study 2

# Additional considerations (or some better heading)

## Implicit vs. explicit knowledge of limit reference points

* How this is compliant with the DFO precautionary framework and Bill C68
* Not just a backup solution, could be argued that this is a better solution then the usual "explicit" knowledge

## Suggested format of the advice

* Suggested elements to include in a research document
* Suggested elements to include in a SAR
* Potential use of SRs to update advice
* Potential to assess multiple related species simultaneously

## Suggested reassessment frequency

* Annual updating of catch recommendation
* Less frequent revisiting of the OM and potential changes to MP/HCR
* Some suggested interval barring a trigger

## Suggestions for establishing triggers for reassessment

* Identifying mismatches between the operating model and realized data
* Suggested that these are checked on some regular interval
* Which data are we suggesting to check

## Suggestions for including environmental effects

* Tie into bill C68 and ecosystem approach to fisheries management working group
* Perhaps one of the most feasible ways to include environmental effects is via operating models

## Suggestions for using the approach to determine the value of information

* Possibly draw on the value of aging data for English sole from a case study as an example
* Can also suggest other possible uses, e.g., changes to survey coverage

## Suggestions for use in rebuilding plans

* Brief overview
* Note the upcoming yelloweye inside application

# Appendix: Candidate management procedures

* How we picked them
* Document them
* Give examples of where they have been used

# Appendix: A summary of the important features of the DLMtool operating model

* a

# Appendix: Case study towards the more data-limited spectrum (Shortraker Rockfish)

# Appendix: Case study towards more data-rich/moderate spectrum (English Sole?)

----------------------------------------------

## Other topics that could be included:

* status zones versus HCRs (Kronlund and Shelton)
* how this approache is PA framework compliant (Kronlund and Shelton)
* suggestions for integrating new MPs
* a review of what has been done elsewhere (Rob's work)
    - not sure if this should be its own section or woven into the document throughout
