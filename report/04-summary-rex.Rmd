# REX SOLE CASE STUDY

## BACKGROUND
Rex Sole (*Glyptocephalus zachirus*) occurs from central Baja California to the
western Bering Sea, and is generally distributed throughout coastal British 
Columbia (BC). It has been caught in BC at depths between 20 m and greater than 
1000 m, with most captured between 75 m and 450 m. 

## Species Biology
Rex sole have been caught in 
BC waters as large as 58 cm and up to 1.44 kg. The only aged rex sole from BC are
those caught in the Hecate Strait Multispecies Assemblage Bottom Trawl survey in
1998. The oldest rex sole aged from BC was a 34 cm female aged at 15 years,
though individuals have been caught up to length 58 cm. RThis species has been
aged up to 29 years (female) in the Gulf of Alaska [@abookire2006]. Over
Additional otoliths have been collected on BC surveys from 2000-present which 
have yet to be aged.

## History of fishery
Rex sole is a commonly caught
flatfish species in BC groundfish bottom trawl surveys and although it is
commonly caught in the commercial mixed-species bottom trawl fishery, there is
no directed fishery or currently assigned quota. Biomass of rex sole in Hecate 
Strait was estimated in 2012 using research survey data collected between 1984 
and 2003 but rex sole has never been formally assessed in BC. Commercial and
fishery data (catch, lengths, weights, ages, maturity) are available in DFO 
databases for analysis. 

## History of assessment/analytical methods



## Data sources


<!-- information from Hart, Mecklenburg and DFO databases-->

The fishery-independent trawl surveys mentioned above for shortraker rockfish
have also been capturing and collecting data on rex sole since 2003.

The IVQ system initiated in 1997 referred to above applies to all species 
caught in the trawl fishery, including rex sole.

## US 
In the US, rex sole is considered as three separate stocks: the west
coast stock from Washington to California, Gulf of Alaska stock (GOA) and the
Bering Sea stock. It is caught in a directed fishery using bottom trawl gear, 
and is assessed in the GOA every four years using an age-structured model (last fully 
assessed in 2017 {@mcgilliard2017}, 


GOA rex sole biology was examined in 2005, and west coast stock
was examined in 1977 in Oregon. Spawning season was determined to run from
January to June in Oregon, and October (possibly earlier) to May in the GOA.
