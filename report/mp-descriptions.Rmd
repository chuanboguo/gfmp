# Management Procedures

This is a generic review of the available MPs in DLMtool which include TAC-based procedures.

```{r, results='asis', include=FALSE}
mps <- DLMtool::MPtype(DLMtool::avail('MP')) %>%
  dplyr::filter(Recs == "TAC") %>% 
  dplyr::filter(!MP %in% grep("CC[2-9]+", .$MP, value = TRUE) )
csasdown::csas_table(mps)
```

### `AvC`: Average catch

The mean historical catch is calculated and used to set a constant catch limit (TAC). The TAC is calculated as:

$$
\textrm{TAC} = \frac{\sum_{y=1}^{n}C_y}{n}
$$

where $\mathrm{TAC}$ is the catch recommendation, $n$ is the number of historical years, and $C_y$ is the catch in historical year $y$.

### `CC`: Constant catch

The TAC is the average historical catch over the last $n$ years (default 5) [@geromont2015]. The TAC is calculated as:

$$
\textrm{TAC} = (1-x)C_{\textrm{ave}}
$$

where $x$ lies between 0 and 1, and $C_\textrm{ave}$ is average historical catch over the previous $n$ years (default of five). The TAC is constant for all future projections. CC1, CC2, CC3, CC4, and CC5 represent the same MP but with $x =$ 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, and 0.6 respectively.


### `BK_ML`: Beddington and Kirkwood life-history

An MP that sets the TAC based on an approximation of $F_\textrm{max}$ based on the length at first capture relative to the asymptotic length and the von Bertalanffy growth parameters $K$.  $F_\textrm{max}$ is the fishing mortality that produces the maximum yield assuming constant recruitment independent of spawning biomass. The TAC is calculated as

$$
\textrm{TAC} = A F_{\textrm{max}},
$$

where $A$ is vulnerable stock abundance, and $F_{\textrm{max}}$ is calculated as

$$
F_{\textrm{max}} = \frac{0.6K}{0.67-L_c/L_\infty},
$$

where $K$ is the von Bertalanffy growth coefficient, $L_c$ is the length at first capture, and $L_\infty$ is the von Bertalanffy asymptotic length.

Abundance ($A$) is estimated as

$$
A = \frac{\bar{C}}{\left(1-e^{-F}\right)},
$$

where $\bar{C}$ is the mean catch, and $F$ is estimated using mean length data. Specifically, total mortality $Z$ is estimated as and $F$ as calculated as $Z$ - $M$, where $M$ it is assumed known. 

FIXME: add how mean length data are used to estimate Z and F.

**DD** - Delay Difference

A simple delay-difference assessment with UMSY and MSY as leading parameters that estimates the TAC using a time-series of catches and a relative. This model includes observation error only and has does not estimate process error (recruitment deviations). Assumption is that knife-edge selectivity occurs at the age of 50 models it depends on assumptions such as temporally stationary productivity and proportionality between the abundance index and real abundance. The extent to which these assumptions are violated tends to be the biggest driver of performance for this method. See @carruthers2012 and @hilborn1992\.


**Fratio** - $F_{MSY}/M$ ratio methods

Calculates the overfishing limit based on a fixed ratio of FMSY to M multiplied by a current estimate of abundance. This method requires as estimate of current abundance. Special case management procedures *Fratio_CC* and *Fratio_ML* estimate current abundance using average catch and an estimate of F from an age-based catch curve and mean lengths respectively. See @gulland1971 and @martell2013\. The TAC is calculated as:

\begin{equation}
TAC = F_{MSY}A
\end{equation}

where $F_{MSY}$ is calculated as $\frac{F_{MSY}}{M}M$ and $A$ is an estimate of current abundance.


**GB_CC** - Geromont and Butterworth Constant Catch

A simple MP that aims for a reference catch (as a proxy for MSY) subject to imperfect information. The TAC is calculated to be equivalent to a reference catch which is assumed to be a proxy for MSY. The TAC is calculated as:

\begin{equation}
TAC = C_{ref}
\end{equation}

where $C_{ref}$ s a reference catch assumed to be a proxy for MSY. In the MSE $C_{ref}$ is the calculated MSY subject to observation error. See @geromont2015\.

The TAC is subject to the following conditions:

- if next TAC > 1.2 last catch, then TAC = 1.2 last catch
- if next TAC < 0.8 last catch, then TAC = 0.8 last catch
