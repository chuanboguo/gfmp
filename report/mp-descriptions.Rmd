# Management Procedures

This is a generic review of the available MPs in DLMtool which include TAC-based procedures

Available management procedures from DLMtool have been filtered to only include TAC-based procedures which seem plausible to use given the data we have. The details of each are summarazied below.

```{r, results='asis'}
mps <- DLMtool::MPtype(DLMtool::avail('MP')) %>%
  dplyr::filter(Recs == "TAC") %>% 
  dplyr::filter(!MP %in% grep("CC[2-9]+", .$MP, value = TRUE) )
csasdown::csas_table(mps)
```

**AvC** - Average Catch

The mean historical catch is calculated and used to set a constant catch limit (TAC). If the number of stochastic samples of the MP recommendation(s) is greater than 1 then those samples are drawn from a log-normal distribution with mean TAC and standard deviation (in log-space) of 0.2. The TAC is calculated as:

\begin{equation}
TAC = \frac{\sum_{y=1}^{n}C_y}{n}
\end{equation}

where $TAC$ is the the mean catch recommendation, $n$ is the number of historical years, and $C_y$ is the catch in historical year $y$.

**CC1** - Geromont and Butterworth (2015) Constant Catch

The TAC is the average historical catch over the last N years (default 5). Note *CC2*, *CC3*, *CC4*, and *CC5* represent the same MP but with the catch multiplied by 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, and 0.6 respectively. See @geromont2015\. The TAC is calculated as:

\begin{equation}
TAC = (1-x)C_{ave}
\end{equation}

where $x$ lies between 0 and 1, and $C_{ave}$ is average historical catch over the previous $N$ years. The $TAC$ is constant for all future projections.

**DCAC** - Depletion Corrected Average Catch

Calculates a catch limit (dcac; intended as an MSY proxy) based on average historical catch while accounting for the windfall catch that got the stock down to its current depletion level (D).

Depletion is not updated in the future projections. The TAC is static and not updated in the future years. This represents an application of the DCAC method where a catch limit is calculated based on current estimate of depletion and time-series of catch from the beginning of the fishery, and the TAC is fixed at this level for all future projections. See @maccall2009 and @harford2017\. The method calculates the depletion-corrected average catch (dcac) as:

\begin{equation}
DCAC = \frac{\sum_{y=1}^{n}C_y}{n+(1-D)/Y_{pot}}
\end{equation}

where 

\begin{equation}
Y_{pot} = \frac{B_{MSY}}{B_0} \frac{F_{MSY}}{M}M
\end{equation}

where $C_y$ is the historical catches and does not change in the future projections.

**DCAC_40** - Depletion Corrected Average Catch

Current stock biomass is assumed to be exactly at 40 per cent of unfished levels. The 40 percent depletion assumption may not really affect DCAC that much as it already makes TAC recommendations that are quite MSY-like.

**DCAC4010** - Depletion Corrected Average Catch

The dynamic DCAC (depletion is updated) is paired with the 40-10 rule that throttles back the OFL to zero at 10 percent of unfished stock size (the OFL is not subject to downward adjustment above 40 percent unfished). DCAC can overfish below BMSY levels. The 40-10 harvest control rule largely resolves this problem providing an MP with surprisingly good performance even at low stock levels.

**DAAC** - Depletion Corrected Average Catch - Modified

DCAC (with updated Depletion) divided by BMSY/B0 (Bpeak) (Harford and Carruthers, 2017).

**HDAAC** - Hybrid Depletion Corrected Average Catch

Same as DAAC when below BMSY, and DCAC above BMSY (Harford and Carruthers 2017).

**DBSRA** - Depletion-Based Stock Reduction Analysis (DB-SRA)

A method designed for determining a catch limit and management reference points for data-limited fisheries where catches are known from the beginning of exploitation. User prescribed BMSY/B0, M, FMSY/M are used to find B0 and therefore the a catch limit by back-constructing the stock to match a user specified level of stock depletion. See @dick2010 and @dick2011\.

DB-SRA assumes that a complete time-series of catch from the beginning of exploitation is available. Users prescribe estimates of current depletion ($D$), biomass at MSY relative to unfished ($\frac{B_{MSY}}{B_0}$), the natural mortality rate ($M$), and the ratio fishing mortality at MSY to M ($\frac{F_{MSY}}{M}$). The TAC is calculated as:

\begin{equation}
TAC = M \frac{F_{MSY}}{M} DB_0
\end{equation}

**DD** - Delay Difference

A simple delay-difference assessment with UMSY and MSY as leading parameters that estimates the TAC using a time-series of catches and a relative. This model includes observation error only and has does not estimate process error (recruitment deviations). Assumption is that knife-edge selectivity occurs at the age of 50 models it depends on assumptions such as temporally stationary productivity and proportionality between the abundance index and real abundance. The extent to which these assumptions are violated tends to be the biggest driver of performance for this method. See @carruthers2012 and @hilborn1992\.


**Fratio** - $F_{MSY}/M$ ratio methods

Calculates the overfishing limit based on a fixed ratio of FMSY to M multiplied by a current estimate of abundance. This method requires as estimate of current abundance. Special case management procedures *Fratio_CC* and *Fratio_ML* estimate current abundance using average catch and an estimate of F from an age-based catch curve and mean lengths respectively. See @gulland1971 and @martell2013\. The TAC is calculated as:

\begin{equation}
TAC = F_{MSY}A
\end{equation}

where $F_{MSY}$ is calculated as $\frac{F_{MSY}}{M}M$ and $A$ is an estimate of current abundance.


**GB_CC** - Geromont and Butterworth Constant Catch

A simple MP that aims for a reference catch (as a proxy for MSY) subject to imperfect information. The TAC is calculated to be equivalent to a reference catch which is assumed to be a proxy for MSY. The TAC is calculated as:

\begin{equation}
TAC = C_{ref}
\end{equation}

where $C_{ref}$ s a reference catch assumed to be a proxy for MSY. In the MSE $C_{ref}$ is the calculated MSY subject to observation error. See @geromont2015\.

The TAC is subject to the following conditions:

- if next TAC > 1.2 last catch, then TAC = 1.2 last catch
- if next TAC < 0.8 last catch, then TAC = 0.8 last catch
