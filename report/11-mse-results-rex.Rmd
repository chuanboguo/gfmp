(ref:fig-rex-depletion-om)
SSB depeltion trajectories from reference and robustness set OMs.
Some OMs ("M decreasing" and "M increasing") have identical historical trajectories as "Catch eq. 50%", but with a fixed value of M in the historical period (i.e., the change in M only occurs in the projection period).

\clearpage

(ref:fig-rex-converge)
Assessing convergence of the Rex Sole closed-loop simulation under the base OM.
Broad differences between MPs have converged (lines no longer cross each other).
Some MPs with very similar performance may still be exchanging rank order within specific performance metrics as of 200 iterations.
Final inference should probably be drawn on somewhat greater than the 200 iterations shown here.

\clearpage

(ref:fig-rex-tigure) Performance of all candidate MPs for the base OM.
MPs are ordered by decreasing performance metric values from top to bottom starting with the left-most performance metric and using columns from left to right to break any ties.
The color shading reflects the underlying numbers.

(ref:fig-rex-proj-ceq50) Historical and projected SSB/SSB~MSY~, F/F~MSY~, and catch across satisficed and reference MPs for the base OM.
Dark line indicates the median value and the darker and lighter shaded ribbons indicate the 50% and 90% quantiles.
Thin gray lines represent illustrative simulation iterations.
The vertical dashed line indicates the last year of the historical period.
The horizontal dashed lines indicate SSB/SSB~MSY~ = 1, 0.8, and 0.4; F/F~MSY~ = 1; and catch = catch from the last historical year.

\clearpage

(ref:fig-rex-proj-failed) Historical and projected SSB/SSB~MSY~, F/F~MSY~, and catch for the base OM across example MPs that did **not** pass the satisficing criteria. In cases where similar MPs existed but had similar performance, only one is shown as an example (e.g., for .IDX and .IDX_smooth, only .IDX_smooth is shown).
Caption is otherwise the same as Figure \@ref(fig:rex-proj-ceq50).

(ref:fig-rex-kobe) SSB/SSB~MSY~ and F/F~MSY~ values from the final year of the projections across all iterations.

(ref:fig-rex-worm) Trajectory of SSB/SSB~MSY~ and F/F~MSY~ values summarized across iterations.

(ref:fig-rex-sens-bbmsy) 
This visualization illustrates the sensitivity of some quantity of interest (y-axis; here mean B/B~MSY~ in years 36--50 of the projection) to OM parameter values (x-axis).
<!-- A variety of MPs are illustrated across rows. -->
<!-- Each point corresponds to simulation iteration and the solid lines correspond to a loess smoother (encompassing a 75% moving window of the data). -->
<!-- For example, the top-left panel illustrates the sensitivity of the MP ".ICI" in terms of the mean B/B~MSY~ in years 36--50 across different values of D (depletion in the final historical year). -->
<!-- For iterations that had a lower value of D (more depleted in the final historical year) there is a wider spread of possible B/B~MSY~ values in years 36--50 (left side of panel). -->
<!-- Iterations that had a higher value of D (right side of panel) have a more consistent B/B~MSY~ in years 36--50. -->
<!-- Note that none of these panels show strong patterns of sensitivity. -->
<!-- Any strong pattern in the points with changes in an OM parameter value highlight that an MP is sensitive to that OM parameter value. -->

\clearpage

(ref:fig-rex-proj-sens) 
This visualization illustrates the sensitivity of some quantity of interest (y-axis; here B/B~MSY~) to high and low values (colors) of various OM parameters (columns) over time.
<!-- A variety of MPs are illustrated across rows. -->
<!-- The solid lines correspond to median values and shaded ribbons correspond to some quantile (here 0.15 and 0.85) to indicate variability across iterations. -->
<!-- For each OM parameter value and MP, the iterations from the top and lower third quantiles have been retained and the middle third has been discarded. -->
<!-- Substantial differences between the trajectories for the two colours would indicate that the quantity of interest is sensitive to high or low values of that OM parameter. -->
<!-- For example, the first column illustrates that all the MPs are somewhat sensitive to depletion in the final historical year in terms of B/B~MSY~. -->
