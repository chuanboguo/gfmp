# INTRODUCTION

## BACKGROUND

DFO fishery-independent surveys encounter over 200 groundfish species in the Pacific region. Of these, approximately 100 are regularly caught in the British Columbia (BC) integrated groundfish fishery. The Pacific Region Groundfish Integrated Fisheries Management Plan (IFMP)[@dfo2017] lists approximately 80 species-area fish stocks for which annual Total Allowable Catches (TACs) are required, most of which are applied as Individual Transferable Quotas (ITQs) within the BC integrated groundfish fishery. 

The majority of species encountered by the integrated groundfish fishery can be considered data-limited, meaning they lack sufficient informative data to perform full statistical age-structured stock assessments for provision of scientific advice on TACs. In recent decades, DFO stock assessment resources have focused on assessing a subset of the more data-rich stocks intensively, leaving many stocks without current assessment advice.

## MOTIVATION

The Canadian Sustainable Fisheries Framework lays the foundation for the precautionary approach (PA) to fisheries management in Canada [@dfo2006; @dfo2009]. The PA Framework relies on the definition of biological reference points (BRPs), which define biomass targets as well as low biomass thresholds to be avoided with high probability. The approach requires that fishing mortality be adjusted in relation to two levels of stock status---an Upper Stock Reference (USR) and a Limit Reference Point (LRP)--that delineate when fishing mortality is reduced or ceased (Figure \@ref(fig:pa-illustration)). The LRP and USR delineate three stock status zones ("healthy", "cautious", and "critical"). Of particular importance is the LRP, which is defined as the spawning biomass below which serious harm may occur to the stock. Other key elements of the PA Framework include a harvest control rule (HCR), which determines allowable removal rates in each of the three stock status zones, and the need to take into account risk and uncertainty when developing BRPs and determinining stock status in relation to BRPs [@dfo2006; @dfo2009].

<!-- *TO DO: Decide whether to run with the existing PA diagram or delineate Operational Control Points from Reference Points. Would also include text here. Argument against is to keep things simple and focused on the PA as stated. Argument for is that we should follow up on previous published advice for Groundfish and Herring that the fishing "cutoff" needs to be separated from the LRP to be consistent with definition of the LRP as a point of "serious harm", i.e., we shouldn't fish right down to it ... * -->

<!-- *RF: Having read the C-68 implementation plan, I think we stick with the original PA diagram* -->

<!-- *TO DO: Update dates below to reflect current progress of the Fisheries Act* -->

On June 21, 2019, major amendments to Canada's *Fisheries Act* received Royal Assent, thus passing them into Canadian law. Among many other amendments, provisions in the new *Fisheries Act* require that fish stocks to be managed at sustainable levels, specifically at biomass levels above the LRP. Hereafter referred to as the "Fish Stocks provisions", the provisions state:

> **Measures to maintain fish stocks**
> 6.1(1) In the management of fisheries, the Minister shall implement measures to maintain prescribed major fish stocks at or above the level necessary to promote the sustainability of the stock, taking into account the biology of the fish and the environmental conditions affecting the stock.

> **Limit reference point**
> 6.1 (2) If the Minister is of the opinion that it is not feasible or appropriate, for cultural reasons or because of adverse socio-economic impacts, to implement the measures referred to in subsection (1), the Minister shall set a limit reference point and implement measures to maintain the fish stock at or above that point, taking into account the biology of the fish and the environmental conditions affecting the stock.

> **Plan to rebuild**
> 6.2(1) If a prescribed major fish stock has declined to or below its limit reference point, the Minister shall develop a plan to rebuild the stock to or above that point in the affected area, taking into account the biology of the fish and the environmental conditions affecting the stock, and implement it within the period provided for in the plan.

For data-limited stocks, data are generally insufficient to adequately account for uncertainty in development of LRPs and assessment of stock status relative to LRPs. To comply with the above Fish Stocks provisions for data-limited species, it is therefore necessary to develop defensible methods and a framework for setting catch limits that promote sustainability and maintain stocks above their LRP.

*TODO: define "data-limited". The C68 implementation plan has a definition we can use, to be consistent with them*

## TIERED APPROACHES

Many other nations and governing bodies have established frameworks for assessing data-limited fisheries---often through "tiered" approaches (e.g., United States [@newman2015], ICES [@ices2012], Australia [@smith2009]). A tiered approach places stocks into ranked categories (tiers) based on the
types and quality of available data. Specific data-limited methods for setting catch limits are identified for each tier, depending on the available data. Arbitrary buffers may also be added to recommended catch limits in each tier (e.g., reduce recommended catch limit by 20%), to attempt to account for the additional uncertainty inherent in more data-limited tiers. 

In 2016, a CSAS workshop was held in the Pacific region to review international tiered approaches, as a preliminary evaluation of the suitability of a tiered approach for the BC integrated groundfish fishery [@dfo2016tiered]. Instead of recommending a discrete tiered approach, as described above, the workshop recommended considering data-richness on a continuous scale and simulation-testing multiple management procedures (MPs) on a stock-by-stock basis to identify data-limited methods that would best meet policy and fishery objectives, explicitly accounting for risk. The simulation-testing be done using a closed-loop simulation, or management strategy evaluation (MSE) approach.

## MANAGEMENT-ORIENTED APPROACHES

In the scientific literature and in practice around the world, there has been a movement towards mnagement-oriented approaches to stock assessment and fisheries management [e.g., @butterworth1999; @rademeyer2007; @berkson2015; @geromont2015; @punt2016; @carruthers2016]. Whereas traditional stock assessment traditionally focuses on estimation of biological parameters, a management-oriented, or management-strategy-evaluation (MSE), approach focuses on identifying management procedures (MPs) that perform best with respect to agreed-upon management objectives when implemented in a closed-loop simulation environment (Figure \@ref(fig:mse-chart-basic)).

Management strategy evaluation is distinguished from conventional stock assessment approaches because it simulates feedback between implementation of the MPs and one or more OMs. Through closed-loop simulation, MSE not only takes into account the effect of the MPs on the system but also the future data collected from the system and its use in the MPs [@punt2016]. The MP may be a simple empirical rule such as an adjustment to catch based on a change in an index of abundance, or may represent a more complex set of choices including data collection, stock assessment method, and harvest control rule.

```

The scientific literature reports a large number of data-limited MPs, which have been shown to have variable performance across conditions such as species life history and levels of biomass depletion [e.g., @carruthers2014; @carruthers2016]. Closed-loop simulation testing of data-limited MPs allows for evaluation of relative performance of MPs across a range of uncertainties in, for example, underlying fish biology, observation error, estimation error, and implementation error [e.g., @kell2006; @carruthers2016]. Importantly, a management-oriented approach enables ranking of MPs with respect to meeting objectives, and enables evaluation of trade-offs among competing objectives (e.g., conservation and economic objectives).

A toolkit for applying closed-loop simulation for data-limited MPs has recently been developed by researchers at the University of British Columbia, in partnership with the Natural Resources Defense Council, DFO and other partners [@carruthers2018]. The Data-Limited Toolkit, [DLMtool](https://www.datalimitedtoolkit.org/) enables rapid assessment of a large number of data-limited MPs and ranking of MPs according to to identified conservation and economic objectives.

## OBJECTIVES OF THIS DOCUMENT

<!-- *TODO: We should include a note about our choice of the terminology "management-procedure framework", as the section above and best practices section refer to MSE and/MOP.* -->
<!-- See last sentence of the next paragraph as a rough draft. Feel free to change* -->

This project aims to develop a management procedure (MP) framework for selecting methods for provision of catch advice for Pacific groundfish stocks that do not have sufficient data for full statistical stock assessments. In doing so, it aims to improve the capacity of DFO to meet the Fish Stocks provisions of the *Fisheries Act* for data-limited species. The management procedure framework will apply closed-loop simulation to formalize the process of testing and selecting MPs for data-limited groundfish stocks, which will support the provision of scientific advice to fisheries managers. We choose the terminology MP Framework to clearly specify the focus on selection of best-performing MPs, rather than focusing on the available data.

The project will focus on developing appropriate operating models, testing suites of management procedures, and determining management procedures that best meet the objectives of fisheries management and stakeholders for some example stocks with different life histories. This work builds on recent work by @anderson2019synopsis, which is a comprehensive, reproducible data synopsis for all Pacific groundfish species encountered by DFO surveys and commercial fisheries in BC. Data and empirical analyses from the synopsis are used to develop operating models within DLMtool [@carruthers2018], which are then used for simulation testing a range of data-limited MPs against performance metrics. The closed-loop simulation approach will allow analysts to use the available data for specific stocks rather than prescribing one MP per data tier, as in traditional "tiered" approaches. 

## EXPECTED BENEFITS

There are a number of expected benefits of this project. Compared to the current status quo, this framework will allow DFO to:

* provide scientific catch advice for more stocks;
* develop a standardized and transparent approach across stocks; 
* test performance of data-limited methods for providing catch advice with respect to meeting sustainability objectives;
* reduce the turnaround time between requests for science advice and provision of advice; and 
* help build an understanding of the most important data needs and research priorities for reducing uncertainty in stock assessment advice. 

Importantly, the framework will demonstrate methods to improve capacity for DFO Science to provide sustainable catch advice for data-limited stocks that is consistent with Canada's PA Framework, and therefore bring data-limited stocks into compliance with the Fish Stocks provisions of the *Fisheries Act*.
