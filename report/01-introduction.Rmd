# INTRODUCTION

## BACKGROUND

DFO fishery-independent surveys encounter over 200 groundfish species in the Pacific region. Of these, approximately 100 are regularly caught in the British Columbia (BC) integrated groundfish fishery. The Pacific Region Groundfish Integrated Fisheries Management Plan (IFMP)[@dfo2017] lists approximately 80 species-area fish stocks for which annual Total Allowable Catches (TACs) are required, most of which are applied as Individual Transferable Quotas (ITQs) within the BC integrated groundfish fishery. 

In recent decades, advice on TACs for Pacific groundfish species has been developed using statistical stock assessment models that rely on indices of abundance, age-composition, commercial catch, and biological data that enable estimation of key population metrics such as stock status, relative depletion, recruitment, growth, fishery selectivity, and natural and fishing mortality. These stock assessment models are data and resource-intensive, with only a few assessments produced each year with available data and Science sector resources. 

The majority of fish stocks encountered by the integrated groundfish fishery are considered data-limited (or data-poor), where data-limited stocks are defined as those with insufficient data to: a) reliably estimate stock status; or b) estimate abundance or productivity with conventional stock assessment methods such as statistical models [@dowling2015; @dowling2015a]. Many of these stocks are without current assessment advice.


## MOTIVATION

The Canadian Sustainable Fisheries Framework (SFF) lays the foundation for the precautionary approach (PA) to fisheries management in Canada [@dfo2006; @dfo2009]. The PA Framework relies on the definition of biological reference points (BRPs), which define biomass targets as well as low biomass thresholds to be avoided with high probability. The approach requires that fishing mortality be adjusted in relation to two levels of stock status---an Upper Stock Reference (USR) and a Limit Reference Point (LRP) (Figure \@ref(fig:pa-illustration)). The LRP and USR delineate three stock status zones ("healthy", "cautious", and "critical"). Of particular importance is the LRP, which is defined as the spawning biomass below which serious harm may occur to the stock. Other key elements of the PA Framework include a harvest control rule (HCR), which determines allowable removal rates in each of the three stock status zones (e.g., Figure \@ref(fig:pa-illustration)), and the need to take into account risk and uncertainty when developing BRPs and determinining stock status in relation to BRPs [@dfo2006; @dfo2009].

On June 21, 2019, major amendments to Canada's *Fisheries Act* received Royal Assent, thus passing them into Canadian law. Among many other amendments, provisions in the new *Fisheries Act* require that fish stocks be managed at sustainable levels, specifically at biomass levels above the LRP. Hereafter referred to as the "Fish Stocks provisions", the provisions legislate elements of Canada's SFF and PA Framework, and state:

> **Measures to maintain fish stocks**
> 6.1(1) In the management of fisheries, the Minister shall implement measures to maintain prescribed major fish stocks at or above the level necessary to promote the sustainability of the stock, taking into account the biology of the fish and the environmental conditions affecting the stock.

> **Limit reference point**
> 6.1 (2) If the Minister is of the opinion that it is not feasible or appropriate, for cultural reasons or because of adverse socio-economic impacts, to implement the measures referred to in subsection (1), the Minister shall set a limit reference point and implement measures to maintain the fish stock at or above that point, taking into account the biology of the fish and the environmental conditions affecting the stock.

> **Plan to rebuild**
> 6.2(1) If a prescribed major fish stock has declined to or below its limit reference point, the Minister shall develop a plan to rebuild the stock to or above that point in the affected area, taking into account the biology of the fish and the environmental conditions affecting the stock, and implement it within the period provided for in the plan.

For data-limited stocks, data are generally insufficient to adequately account for uncertainty in development of BRPs and assessment of stock status relative to BRPs. To comply with the legal requirements identified in the Fish Stocks provisions for data-limited species, it is therefore necessary to develop defensible methods and a framework for setting catch limits that promote sustainability and maintain stocks above their LRP.

## TIERED APPROACHES

Many other nations and governing bodies have established frameworks for assessing data-limited fish stocks ---often through "tiered" approaches (e.g., United States [@newman2015], ICES [@ices2012], Australia [@smith2009]). A tiered approach places stocks into ranked categories (tiers) based on the
types and quality of available data. Specific data-limited methods for setting catch limits are identified for each tier, depending on the available data. Arbitrary buffers may also be added to recommended catch limits in each tier (e.g., reduce recommended catch limit by 20%), to attempt to account for the additional uncertainty inherent in more data-limited tiers. 

In 2016, a CSAS workshop was held in the Pacific region to review international tiered approaches, as a preliminary evaluation of the suitability of a tiered approach for the BC integrated groundfish fishery [@dfo2016tiered]. Instead of recommending a discrete tiered approach based on data-availability, the workshop recommended considering data-richness on a continuous scale and simulation-testing multiple alternative management procedures (MPs) on a stock-by-stock basis, using a management-oriented, or management strategy evaluation (MSE), approach to identify data-limited MPs that would best meet policy and fishery objectives, explicitly accounting for risk.

## MANAGEMENT-ORIENTED APPROACHES

In the scientific literature and in practice around the world, there has been a movement towards management-oriented (or MSE) approaches to stock assessment and fisheries management [e.g., @butterworth1999; @rademeyer2007; @berkson2015; @geromont2015; @punt2016; @carruthers2016]. Whereas traditional stock assessment methods focus on estimation of biological parameters and stock status explicitly, a management-oriented approach focuses on identifying MPs that perform best with respect to policy and fishery objectives when implemented in a "closed-loop" simulation environment (Figure \@ref(fig:mse-chart-basic)).

Closed-loop simulation is distinguished from conventional stock assessment because it simulates feedback between implementation of the MPs and the simulated system representing the fish stock and its environment, described by one or more operating models (OMs). This approach not only takes into account the effect of the MPs on the system but also the future data collected from the system and its use in the MPs [@punt2016]. Data-limited MPs may be a simple empirical rule, such as an adjustment to catch based on a change in an index of abundance, or may be based on more complex methods incorporating multiple data sources.

```

The scientific literature reports a very large number of data-limited MPs. When tested in closed-loop simulation environments, data-limited MPs have shown variable performance across conditions such as species life-history and levels of biomass depletion [e.g., @carruthers2014; @carruthers2016]. Closed-loop simulation-testing of data-limited MPs allows for evaluation of relative performance of MPs across a range of uncertainties in, for example, underlying fish biology, observation error, estimation error, and implementation error [e.g., @kell2006; @carruthers2016]. Importantly, a management-oriented approach enables ranking of MPs with respect to meeting objectives, and enables evaluation of trade-offs among competing objectives (e.g., policy-based conservation objectives and economic objectives).

A toolkit for applying closed-loop simulation for data-limited MPs has recently been developed by researchers at the University of British Columbia, in partnership with DFO, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and other partners [@carruthers2018]. The Data-Limited Toolkit, [DLMtool](https://www.datalimitedtoolkit.org/) enables rapid assessment of a large number of data-limited MPs, and ranking of MPs according to customizable conservation and economic objectives, and evaluation of key trade-offs.

## OBJECTIVES OF THIS DOCUMENT

This project aims to develop a management procedure (MP) framework for selecting methods for provision of catch advice for Pacific groundfish stocks that do not have sufficient data for full statistical stock assessments. In doing so, it aims to improve the capacity of DFO to meet the Fish Stocks provisions of the *Fisheries Act* for data-limited species. The management procedure framework will apply closed-loop simulation to formalize the process of testing and selecting MPs for data-limited groundfish stocks, which will support the provision of scientific advice to fisheries managers. We choose the terminology MP Framework to clearly specify the focus on selection of best-performing MPs, rather than focusing on the available data.

The project will develop methodologies for developing appropriate OMs, testing suites of MPs, and identifying MPs that best meet the objectives of fisheries management and stakeholders for some example stocks with different life histories. This work builds on recent work by @anderson2019synopsis, which is a comprehensive, reproducible data synopsis for all Pacific groundfish species encountered by DFO surveys and commercial fisheries in BC. Data and empirical analyses from the synopsis are used to develop OMs using the DLMtool toolkit [@carruthers2018], which are then used for simulation testing a range of data-limited MPs against performance metrics. Steps of the process are described more fully in the next sections. 

## EXPECTED BENEFITS

There are a number of expected benefits of this project. Compared to the current status quo, this framework will allow DFO to:

* provide evidence-based catch advice for more stocks;
* develop a standardized and transparent approach across stocks; 
* test performance of data-limited MPs for providing catch advice with respect to meeting sustainability objectives;
* reduce the turnaround time between requests for science advice and provision of advice; and 
* help build an understanding of the most important data needs and research priorities for reducing uncertainty in stock assessment advice. 

Critically, the framework will develop methods to improve capacity for DFO Science to provide sustainable, data-limited catch advice, consistent with Canada's PA Framework as legislated under the Fish Stocks provisions, and therefore bring data-limited stocks into compliance with the Fish Stocks provisions of the *Fisheries Act*.
