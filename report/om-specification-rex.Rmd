TODO: in the data from this analysis report the minimum length caught in 3C is 14. Need to figure out why these are not in our filtered rex data.

Based on the slot `isRel` below, this lot needs to be filled in proportion of size-of-maturity. The 95% CI of size at maturity from this analysis is `r stockrex@L50[[1]]` to `r stockrex@L50[[2]]`. The shortest length fish in the commercial samples is `r min_caught`, although commercial samples are only available from 2015 in WCVI.

### Vmaxlen {#app:desc-fleet-vmaxlen-rex}

```{r}
average_cv <- dplyr::filter(drex$survey_index, survey_abbrev == "SYN WCVI") %>%

This will depend on whether we want to use one or more of the trawl surveys or commercial CPUE as the index. For now I will assume that we will work with one of the trawl surveys. In that case, the CV on the index is quite large for this species. For example, the best sampling is probably on the West Coast of Haidai Gwaii, and there the average CV is `r average_cv`. Let's use that for now but we could add some uncertainty around this. FIXME
