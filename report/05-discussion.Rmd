# DISCUSSION

In this document we have presented a framework for implementing an MP approach to providing Science advice for groundfish in British Columbia.
We outlined a approach to developing appropriate OMs, testing suites of MPs, and identifying MPs that best meet the objectives of fisheries management and stakeholders.
Ultimately, it is our aim that the Framework improves the capacity of DFO to meet the requirements of Canada's Sustainable Fisheries Framework and the Fish Stocks provisions of the *Fisheries Act* for data-limited species.
Although the Framework does not emphasize explicit knowledge of fish-stock reference points, it emphasizes selecting management approaches that have a high likelihood of maintaining fish stocks above implicitly known reference points across multiple plausible states of nature.
In the following discussion we highlight issues regarding reference points, MP tuning, assessment frequency and triggers, the inclusion of environmental effects, assessing the value of information, and use of the Framework as part of stock rebuilding plans.

## IMPLICIT VS. EXPLICIT KNOWLEDGE OF LIMIT REFERENCE POINTS

This MP framework, and all MSE processes, differ from conventional stock assessments in the way science advice is delivered.
In most Pacific Groundfish stock assessments [e.g., @yamanaka2011; @starr2017; @forrest2019], catch advice is presented in the form of decision tables, where probabilities of breaching reference points (e.g., probability of the stock falling below the LRP) are presented over a range of possible future TAC levels.
Uncertainty can be incorporated into the process in two main ways: 1) within a single model, through treating model parameters (e.g., $M$, $R_0$, $h$, process, and observation error terms) as random variables; and/or 2) developing alternative models to test sensitivity to model assumptions.
In the latter case, results from some of these sensitivity models may be averaged to produce a model-averaged decision-table [e.g., @forrest2019], integrating uncertainties across multiple models.
This process depends upon explicit reporting of reference points and estimation of stock status.
Following the production of a decision table, it is then the job of the decision-makers to select a future TAC based on the probabilities presented in the decision table and their consideration of other factors such as economic needs of the fishery.
In this process, consideration of risk (i.e., probability of breaching reference points and resulting impacts) occurs at the final step of the decision-making process and may not always be transparent or be related to agreed-upon objectives.

MP Frameworks differ from conventional assessments in two key ways: (1) Reference points and stock status are not explicitly reported; and (2) Objectives related to the probability of breaching reference points must be agreed upon at the beginning of the process, i.e., at Step 2 of the best practices (Section \@ref(sec:best2)).
Reference points and stock status are therefore still an integral component of the framework---they are calculated in the OMs and are built into the performance metrics.
Critically, agreement on acceptable risk (acceptable probabilities of breaching reference points) must be reached at the beginning of the process so that performance metrics and satisficing criteria can be established.
The final decision point in this process is the MP that delivers a TAC that meets objectives, while, ideally, also achieving acceptable trade-offs among other objectives such as catch or variability in catch.
An advantage of MP frameworks is that all objectives must be transparently stated and are "baked in" to the final catch advice.

We note that, for many species, especially data-limited species, it is not possible to reliably estimate biological reference points or estimate stock status.
MP frameworks such as this one may be especially important for these species.
The Sustainable Fisheries Framework and the Fish Stocks provisions of the *Fisheries Act* require that fish stocks be maintained at sustainable levels, and particularly above the LRP (Section \@ref(sec:intro-motivation)).
This framework implicitly preserves the intent of these policies, despite the fact that reference points and stock status cannot be explicitly provided.
The framework therefore increases capacity for provision of Sustainable-Fisheries-Framework- and Fish-Stocks-Provisions-compliant catch advice for data-limited species.
We recommend that products such as [DFO's sustainability survey](https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/reports-rapports/regs/sff-cpd/survey-sondage/index-en.html) be flexible to accommodate status reports from MSE processes, which may use alternative wording such as "under the current management procedure, the stock has a less than [X]% probability of being below the LRP over a [Y]-year time frame".

## TUNING MPs

Many of the MPs in this framework are characterized by one or more parameters that control how the TAC should change in response to changes in the survey index (Appendix \@ref(app:MPs)).
For example, the Itarget MPs have four "tuning" parameters, $w$, $x$, $\lambda$, and $\delta$, which control the rate and scale of TAC adjustments in response to the index (Section \@ref(sec:mp-itarget)).
In our Rex Sole case study, we tested six versions of the Itarget MPs over a fairly coarse scale of the tuning parameters.
In this particular case, several of the MPs performed well with respect to satisficing criteria so we did not explore more combinations.
However, in some applications of the framework it may be desirable to iteratively tune MPs on a fine scale to achieve desired performance outcomes.

There is a trade-off between testing a larger set of generic MPs across a coarse array of tuning parameters and honing in on better-performing MPs via the satisficing step vs. focusing effort on a few highly "tuned" MPs.
In cases where generic MPs perform poorly, the latter approach may be desirable.
This latter approach may also be desirable in more mature processes with strong stakeholder engagement, where MPs can be tuned iteratively to meet a more refined set of objectives [e.g., @cox2008a].
Ultimately, the decision about whether to evaluate generic or finely tuned MPs will be made on a stock-by-stock basis.
The process may start with more generic MPs and graduate to more finely tuned MPs as experience is gained with the performance of specific MPs.

## REASSESSMENT FREQUENCY AND TRIGGERS

In general, the purpose of an MP framework is to identify and select a robust MP that can be left in place for an agreed amount of time.
We do not recommend a specific interval between assessments in this framework and suggest this should be done on a stock-by-stock basis.
We suggest that the MP Framework itself can be used to test appropriate re-assessment intervals for individual fish stocks [e.g., @huynh2020].
Interim checks between assessments are also recommended to ensure the selected MP is performing as expected.

In addition to the best practice steps described in Section \@ref(sec:best-practices), @carruthers2018 describe a final evaluation step, where performance of the selected MP is formally reviewed once it has been implemented.
Departures from an MP's predicted performance have been termed "exceptional circumstances", where the observed system dynamics fall outside the range of scenarios specified in the OM(s), over which the MPs were demonstrated to be robust [@butterworth2008].
Exceptional circumstances can  be caused either by misspecification of the original OM(s), or can be due to unforeseen changes in the future system dynamics that were not captured in the original OM(s) (e.g., changes in natural mortality, growth, recruitment, or fishing dynamics).
Evidence for exceptional circumstances, occurring within the recommended assessment interval, would trigger a review of the MP, possibly resulting in a new MSE, or an adjustment to the selected MP [@carruthers_hordyk_2018].

In established MSE processes [e.g., @cox2008a], informal evaluation of the performance of MPs may be done at regular intervals as the MP is applied and new data are gathered (e.g., survey and commercial CPUE information).
@carruthers_hordyk_2018 list several examples of MSEs where formal protocols for detecting exceptional circumstances have been established.
In general, formal protocols have included monitoring the biomass index, catch, and sometimes other data-types such as age-composition data, and comparing observations to the OM predictions.
Examples of triggers for re-evaluation include observed data falling outside some confidence interval of the OM-predicted data (e.g., 90% or 95%).
@carruthers_hordyk_2018 recommend testing the statistical power of formal protocols to detect exceptional circumstances, which may be especially important for data-limited species where statistical power may be low due to large uncertainty in OM dynamics.
For example if the confidence interval of a predicted index is extremely large due to OM uncertainties, the likelihood of future observed indices falling outside its range may be low.
It may therefore be necessary to use more rigorous test statistics, possibly based on multiple sources of data [e.g., examples provided in @carruthers_hordyk_2018].

We recommend regular evaluation of the performance of MPs recommended by this framework, but recognize that a formal protocol has not yet been established.
We therefore also recommend further analyses to evaluate protocols for detecting exceptional circumstances as a matter of priority.

## INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS

<!--TODO: SA please check black swan section ... very rough -->

The Fish Stocks provisions of the *Fisheries Act* state that fisheries management decisions shall take "into account the biology of the fish and the environmental conditions affecting the stock" (Section \@ref(sec:intro-motivation)).
Changing environmental conditions can affect fish stocks in many ways, including impacting natural mortality rates, growth rates and condition, recruitment success, and spatial distribution, which may impact fishery catchability or selectivity.
Robust methods for including environmental considerations into single-species catch advice are not well-established in fisheries decision-making environments [but see @haltuch2011; @haltuch2019 @crone2019].
This is because of large uncertainties associated with observing complex marine environments and understanding mechanisms linking fish population dynamics with environmental change [@myers1995].
Unless mechanisms are well-understood [e.g., @swain2015], incorporating environmental variables into stock assessments does not necessarily improve advice [@punt2014].

Closed loop simulation-testing is an important means of evaluating how MPs perform in the presence of uncertainty and a changing environment [e.g., @haltuch2009; @haltuch2011; @punt2011b].
In this approach, hypotheses about how environmental variables impact population dynamics are incorporated into the OMs, with the performance of alternative MPs (which may or may not include environmental variables) evaluated in the same way as presented in this framework.
Multiple OMs can be developed that represent multiple hypotheses for environmental effects.
OMs could explicitly include environmental variables (e.g., linking ocean temperature with recruitment deviations, or linking predator abundance with $M$), or could be mechanism-free (e.g., allowing growth parameters or $M$ to vary through time with no specific driver).
The latter, mechanism-free approaches are already straightforward to incorporate into DLMtool operating models, via growth or mortality parameters (see Section \@ref(sec:dlmtool-time-varying)). The Rex Sole case study included one scenario in the robustness set where $M$ increased linearly through time. In this case, no specific mechanism for changing $M$ was provided.

Environmental changes may also increase the frequency of unexpected events such as very large or very small recruitment events.
These are sometimes referred to as "black-swan" events [e.g., @taleb2007; @anderson2017; @anderson2019] and can be incorporated into operating models through the addition of alternative distributions for recruitment anomalies to allow for occasional very large or very small events.
An upcoming application of the MP Framework for the Inside stock of Yelloweye Rockfish (*Sebastes ruberrimus*) will include an OM scenario that incorporates occasional sudden large recruitment events.

We recommend using the tools developed for this MP Framework to further explore simulation-testing of MPs that are robust to changing environmental conditions.

## ASSESSING THE VALUE OF INFORMATION

<!-- Suggest deleting this section. We need to be careful about suggesting we wouldn't use the framework in a given data situation. This document is just about the framework to apply once a decision has been made to use it. It isn't about whether to use it or not, which is a process question-->

<!--Update: just talk about the utility of the framework for testing the VoI, e.g., more or less survey information or age comp data for tuning the SRA. Note that some of these data-limited procedures might work well for data rich species -->

* Possibly draw on the value of aging data for Rex Sole from a case study as an example
* Can also suggest other possible uses, e.g., changes to survey coverage
* Issue #60 "There was also a recommendation to discuss and document process of how species would be selected for data-limited assessment via the MP Framework and how a species could be moved out of the Framework to have more data-rich, conventional assessments. While the availability of quality age-composition data would be the first consideration, this will likely need to be done on a stock-by-stock basis, and in consultation with science, managers, stakeholders, and other interested parties."

## REBUILDING PLANS

The [PA policy](https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/Library/40584781.pdf) and the Fish Stocks provisions of the *Fisheries Act* (Section \@ref(sec:intro-motivation)) require that management measures be put in place if fish stocks are assessed to be in the Critical Zone (i.e., below the LRP).
Rebuilding plans require that management measures should rebuild stocks out of the Critical Zone within a specified time frame (e.g., one or two generation times), with a specified probability.
The MP Framework can be easily modified to test performance of alternative MPs with respect to meeting rebuilding objectives for stocks requiring rebuilding plans.
The only real modifications needed are to the objectives and performance metrics, which are already customizable within this framework.

A challenge for data-limited species is how stocks are assessed to be in the Critical Zone in the first place so that a rebuilding plan is triggered.
However, we suggest that if calibrated OMs overwhelmingly place a fish stock in the Critical Zone across a range of plausible OM assumptions, this could be grounds for triggering a rebuilding plan.
This framework is currently being applied to evaluate alternative data-limited MPs for the rebuilding plan for the Inside stock of Yelloweye Rockfish in British Columbia.
