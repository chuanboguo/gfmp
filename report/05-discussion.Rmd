# DISCUSSION

*Final discussion may include other topics. Below is a rough start.*

*Summary intro paragraph*

<!-- Sean -->

* re-sample data | `rnorm` etc. > `runif`

## IMPLICIT VS. EXPLICIT KNOWLEDGE OF LIMIT REFERENCE POINTS
<!--RF-->
* How this is compliant with the DFO precautionary framework and Bill C68
* Not just a backup solution, could be argued that this is "implicit" knowledge is a better solution then the usual "explicit" knowledge
* Where is risk? Issue #61

## TUNING MPs
* See Issue #55
* There is a trade-off between more generic MPs (work across a coarse array of tuning parameters and hone in on a finer grid of better-performing MPs) vs highly "tuned" MPs
* Importance of transparency about what was explored and how "tuning" was done
* Extent of tuning exercise may depend on how well MPs are performing. If all performing badly, may need to go on more extensive tuning expedition

## REASSESSMENT FREQUENCY AND TRIGGERS
<!-- RF -->
* Annual(?) updating of catch recommendation -- see also Issue #82
* Less frequent revisiting of the OM and potential changes to MP/HCR
* Some suggested interval barring a trigger

* Identifying mismatches between the operating model and realized data
* Suggested that these are checked on some regular interval
* Which data are we suggesting to check

* Is the future index outside the projection envelope?
* Have the management decisions departed from the MP?
* Carruthers and Hordyk CJFAS paper - multivariate approach
* Simple would be better

## INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS
<!-- RF -->
* Tie into bill C68 and ecosystem approach to fisheries management working group
* e.g., increasing M scenario
* Perhaps one of the most feasible ways to include environmental effects is via operating models

## ASSESSING THE VALUE OF INFORMATION

* Possibly draw on the value of aging data for Rex sole from a case study as an example
* Can also suggest other possible uses, e.g., changes to survey coverage
* Issue #60 "There was also a recommendation to discuss and document process of how species would be selected for data-limited assessment via the MP Framework and how a species could be moved out of the Framework to have more data-rich, conventional assessments. While the availability of quality age-composition data would be the first consideration, this will likely need to be done on a stock-by-stock basis, and in consultation with science, managers, stakeholders, and other interested parties."

## REBUILDING PLANS

* Brief overview
* Note the upcoming yelloweye inside application
