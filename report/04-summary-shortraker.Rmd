# SHORTRAKER ROCKFISH CASE STUDY


## BACKGROUND
Shortraker rockfish (*Sebastes borealis*) occurs throughout the North Pacific 
from Japan, the Okhotsk Sea, and southeastern Kamchatka to the Bering Sea and
Aleutian Islands and south to California. It has been caught in BC at depths
between 20 m and 1300 m, with most captured between 30 m and 140 m. 
Shortraker can grow as large as 120 cm and up to 30 kg, and has been caught in 
BC waters as large as 108 cm and up to 21.7 kg. The oldest Shortraker aged in BC
was a female caught in a trawl survey on the West Coast of Haida Gwaii in 1997
aged at 157 years (ages are known from otoliths collected in surveys conducted
in 1997, 2002-2003, 2006-2008 and 2010-2012; otoliths were also collected on
surveys from 2013-present which have yet to be aged). 

Shortraker rockfish represents a small portion of the trawl and hook and 
line fisheries, and was last assessed as part of the slope rockfish assemblage 
(Pacific ocean perch, yellowmouth rockfish, redstripe rockfish,
rougheye rockfish, shortspine/longspine thornyheads and shortraker rockfish) in 
1998 {@Schnute1999a} and updated in 1999 {@Schnute1999b}. 
These seven species were managed within six major
areas (3C, 3D,AS, 5CD, 5EN, 5ES) for a total of 42 species-area combinations,
called \emph{assessment units}. A detailed catch-at-age analysis was conducted
for one of these assessment units, Pacific ocean perch in area 5AB, as a
benchmark stock, and quoatas for the roteher 41 assessment units resulted from 
scale factors relating each unit to the benchmark stock. Scale factors were 
estimated from historical fisheries data, research surveys, and knowledge from 
expert fishermen. 

All slope rockfish assessments suffer from the lack of reliable time series on
fishery catch. The port monitoring program initiated in 1994 and the at-sea 
observer program initiated in 0ct 1995 have led to major improvements in data 
quality. In the 1998 assessment report, it was noted that depth was an important factor 
influencing trawl catch per unit effort (CPUE), and therefore all analyses
of CPUE data incorporated depth stratification. It was also noted that
CPUE in commercial tows was lower than in survey tows for some species in 
similar time, place and depth. Commercial CPUE data was determined to therefore
not reflect stock abundance; consequently, a fishery-independent industry-
sponsered survey of the slope rockfish was developed in collaboration between
industry and DFO. Also, a newly developed observer database (housing trawl 
observer data starting in 1996, with hook and line observer data to be
added starting in 2006) began to be incorporated into assessments
{@Schnute1999a, @Richards1998}. 

Shortraker rockfish has not been assessed since the 1999 report. 
##?? is it that there was no assessment done because (someone, industry? was an
##assessment attempted?) didn't think we had enough data if CPUE couldn't be used?


Fishery-independent trawl surveys have been conducted in 4 areas, alternately covering two areas 
each year, since 2003. Longline surveys have been conducted in the north and 
south in alternating years since 2006, and the International Pacific Halibut
Commission Fishery Independent Setline Survey has sampled rockfish species 
since 1995 (either on all hooks or the first 20 of each skate).

The trawl fishery underwent a major change in 1997 through the introduction of
individual vessel quotas (IVQs).
