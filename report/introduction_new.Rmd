# INTRODUCTION

## Background
DFO fishery-independent surveys encounter over 200 groundfish species in the Pacific region. Of these, approximately 100 are regularly caught in the BC integrated groundfish fishery. The Pacific Region Groundfish Integrated Fisheries Management Plan (IFMP)[dfo2017] lists approximately 80 species-area fish stocks for which annual Total Allowable Catches (TACs) are required, most of which are applied as Individual Transferable Quotas (ITQs) within the groundfish fishery. 

The majority of species encountered by the integrated groundfish fishery can be considered data-limited, meaning they lack enough informative data to perform full statistical age-structured stock assessments for provision of scientific advice on TACs. In recent decades, DFO stock assessment resources have focused on assessing a subset of the more data-rich stocks intensively, leaving many stocks without current assessment advice.

## Motivation
The Canadian Sustainable Fisheries Framework lays the foundation for the precautionary approach (PA) to fisheries management in Canada [@dfo2006, @dfo2009]. The PA Framework relies upon the definition
of biological reference points (BRPs), which define biomass targets as well as low biomass thresholds to be avoided with high probability. The approach requires that fishing mortality be adjusted in relation to two levels of stock status (a Limit Reference Point and Upper Stock Reference) that delineate when fishing mortality is reduced or ceased (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-pa)). The Limit Reference Point (LRP) and Upper Stock Reference (USR) delineate three stock status zones (Healthy, Cautious and Critical). Of particular importance is the LRP, which is defined as the spawning biomass below which serious harm may occur to the stock. Other key elements of the PA Framework include a harvest control rule (HCR), which determines allowable removal rates in each of the three stock status zones, and the need to take into account risk and uncertainty when developing BRPs and determinining stock status in relation to BRPs [@dfo2006, @dfo2009].


*TO DO: Decide whether to run with the existing PA diagram or delineate Operational Control Points from Reference Points. Would also include text here. Argument against is to keep things simple and focused on the PA as stated. Argument for is that we should follow up on previous published advice for Groundfish and Herring that the fishing "cutoff" needs to be separated from the LRP to be consistent with definition of the LRP as a point of "serious harm", i.e., we shouldn't fish right down to it ... *


On June 21, 2019, major amendments to Canada's *Fisheries Act* received Royal Assent, thus passing them into Canadian law. Among many other amendments, provisions in the new *Fisheries Act* require that fish stocks to be managed at sustainable levels, specifically at biomass levels above the LRP. Hereafter referred to as the Fish Stocks provisions, the provisions state:


> **Measures to maintain fish stocks**

> 6.1(1) In the management of fisheries, the Minister shall implement measures to maintain prescribed major fish stocks at or above the level necessary to promote the sustainability of the stock, taking into account the biology of the fish and the environmental conditions affecting the stock.

> **Limit reference point**

> 6.1 (2) If the Minister is of the opinion that it is not feasible or appropriate, for cultural reasons or because of adverse socio-economic impacts, to implement the measures referred to in subsection (1), the Minister shall set a limit reference point and implement measures to maintain the fish stock at or above that point, taking into account the biology of the fish and the environmental conditions affecting the stock.

> **Plan to rebuild**

> 6.2(1) If a prescribed major fish stock has declined to or below its limit reference point, the Minister shall develop a plan to rebuild the stock to or above that point in the affected area, taking into account the biology of the fish and the environmental conditions affecting the stock, and implement it within the period provided for in the plan.


For data-limited stocks, data are generally insufficient to adequately account for uncertainty in development of LRPs and assessment of stock status relative to LRPs. To comply with the above Fish Stocks provisions for data-limited species, it is therefore necessary to develop defensible methods and a framework for setting catch limits that promote sustainability and maintain stocks above their LRP.


## Tiered approaches
Many other nations and governing bodies have established frameworks for assessing data-limited fisheries --- often through "tiered" approaches (e.g., United States [@newman2015], ICES [@ices2012], Australia [@smith2009]). A tiered approach places stocks into ranked categories (tiers) based on the
types and quality of available data. Specific data-limited methods for setting catch limits are identified for each tier, depending on the available data. Arbitrary buffers may also be added to recommended catch limits in each tier (e.g., reduce recommended catch limit by 20%), to attempt to account for the additional uncertainty inherent in more data-limited tiers. 

In 2016, a CSAS workshop was held in the Pacific region to review international tiered approaches, as a preliminary evaluation of the suitability of a tiered approach for the BC integrated groundfish fishery [@dfo2016tiered]. Instead of recommending a discrete tiered approach, as described above, the workshop recommended considering data-richness on a continuous scale and simulation-testing multiple management procedures (MPs) on a stock-by-stock basis to identify data-limited methods that would best meet policy and fishery objectives, explicitly accounting for risk. The simulation-testing be done using a closed-loop simulation, or management strategy evaluation (MSE) approach.

## Management-oriented approach (management strategy evaluation)
In the scientific literature and in practice around the world, there has been a movement towards mnagement-oriented approaches to stock assessment and fisheries management [e.g., @butterworth1999; @rademeyer2007; @berkson2015; @geromont2015; @punt2016; @carruthers2016]. Whereas traditional stock assessment traditionally focuses on estimation of biological parameters, a management-oriented, or MSE, approach  focuses on identifying management procedures (MPs) that perform best with respect to agreed-upon management objectives when implemented in a closed-loop simulation environment (Figure 2). Importantly, closed-loop simulation incorporates feedback between the MP and the underlying system represented by one or more operating models (OM). The MP may be a simple empirical rule such as an adjustment to catch based on a change in index of abundance, or may represent a more complex set of choices including data collection, stock assessment method and a harvest control rule (HCR). 

*TO DO: We need a simple Closed-Loop Simulation figure here (Figure 2)*

The scientific literature reports a great number of data-limited MPs, which have been shown to have variable performance across conditions such as species life history and levels of biomass depletion [ @carruthers2014; @carruthers2016]. Closed-loop simulation testing of data-limited MPs allows for evaluation of relative performance of MPs across a range of uncertainties in, for example, underlying fish biology, observation error, estimation error, and implementation error [@kell2006; @carruthers2016]. Importantly, a management-oriented approach enables ranking of MPs with respect to meeting objectives, and enables evaluation of trade-offs among competing objectives (e.g., conservation and economic objectives).

A toolkit for applying closed-loop simulation for data-limited MPs has recently been developed by researchers at the University of British Columbia, in partnership with the Natural Resources Defense Council, DFO and other partners [@carruthers2018]. The Data-Limited Toolkit, "DLMtool" (https://www.datalimitedtoolkit.org/) enables rapid assessment of a large number of data-limited MPs and ranking of MPs according to to identified conservation and economic objectives (e.g., probability biomass is below LRP). DLMtool is open-source software (https://github.com/DLMtool/DLMtool), enabling experienced users to customize MPs and performance metrics as needed.

## Objectives of this document
This project aims to develop a "management procedure" framework for selecting methods for provision of catch advice for Pacific groundfish stocks that do not have sufficient data for full statistical stock assessments. In doing so, it aims to improve the capacity of DFO to meet the Fish Stocks provisions of the *Fisheries Act* for data-limited species.

The management procedure framework will apply closed-loop simulation to formalize the process of testing and selecting MPs for data-limited groundfish stocks, which will support the provision of
scientific advice to fisheries managers.The project will focus on developing appropriate operating models, testing suites of management procedures, and determining management procedures that best meet the objectives of fisheries management and stakeholders for some example stocks with different life-histories. 

Development of operating models will be done using the DLMtool toolkit [@carruthers2018], using data and empirical analyses published in recent work by @anderson2019, which is a reproducible data synopsis of the available data and general index trends for candidate groundfish fish stocks.

## Expected Benefits








There are numerous expected benefits of this project. Compared to a traditional
tiered approach, this management-procedure approach is focused on achieving
long-term performance objectives instead of biological estimation; incorporates
feedback between management procedures and the underlying system; and will
allow us to take advantage of available data for specific stocks rather than
prescribing one estimation model per data tier. Compared to the status quo,
this framework will allow DFO to provide scientific advice on more stocks; will
develop a standardized and transparent assessment approach across stocks; will
require less effort to update advice between full re-assessments and thereby
reduce the turnaround time between science advice request and provision of such
advice; and will build an understanding of the most important data needs and
research priorities for reducing uncertainty in stock advice.
