# BEST PRACTICES FOR IMPLEMENTING A MANAGEMENT PROCEDURE APPROACH



Best practices for management strategy evaluation were reviewed by @punt2016.

* Define decision context
* Define specific objectives and performance indicators
* Identify management procedure options
* Define a set of operating models that capture main uncertainties
* Simulate and compute performance indicators
* Rank overall MP performance
* Apply the MP to real fishery

## HOW THE PROPOSED APPROACH ADOPTS THESE BEST PRACTICES

* Define decision context
    - clarify the exact decision, decide on the timeframe, decide on the boundaries of the project, decide on collaborative roles, clarify how final decision will be made
    - give examples throughout including what we propose as starting points

* Define specific objectives and performance indicator
    - suggested starting points for objectives and performance indicators across most stocks this will apply to
    - justify these objectives and performance indicators based on PA framework, literature, and precedent in Canada and elsewhere

* Identify management procedure options
    - summarize candidates that we have narrowed it down to
    - reference the detailed appendix

* Define a set of operating models that capture main uncertainties
    - what are the common main uncertainties that we should make sure to capture
    - what are potential sources of uncertainty that by default we suggest should not be focused on (but could be included on a stock by stock basis)
    - the idea behind robustness sets; example robustness sets
    - consider weights based on relative plausibility (and why by default we suggest avoiding this complexity)

* Simulate and compute performance indicators
    - proposed software (DLMtool)
    	- why use it?
    	- what it can do?
    	- note that the approach is software agnostic
    	- examples of where it has been used
    - how many iterations: checking for convergence of MP selection

* Rank overall MP performance
    - suggested figures and table
    - explain satisficing
    - describe potential default satisficing rules

* Apply the MP to real fishery
    - same MP; real data 
    - reinforce that MP needs to be followed exactly as defined to meet desired objectives
    - if adjustments need to be made this suggests a need to revisit the objectives
