# BEST PRACTICES FOR IMPLEMENTING A MANAGEMENT PROCEDURE APPROACH

@punt2016 reviewed best practices for MSE and identified five key steps in the process (Steps 2-6 below). In large part, DLMtool is designed to follow these steps [@carruthers2018]. In addition, structured decision-making theory [@gregory2012] identifies a critical first step in decision-making processes, which is to define the decision context (Step 1 below).

Importantly, decision-makers, stakeholders and other interested groups (First Nations, NGOs, academics) should be engaged throughout the process, particularly in defining the decision context, setting objective and performance metrics and selection of MPs [e.g., @cox2008a].

### 1. Define the decision context

*TO DO: figure out how to cite the landmark report. We are not allowed to cite unpublished reports in CSAS docs (I don't think), but we could include it in a footnote. I tried doing a footnote but it didn't work. Anyway, here is the ref    ([^1]: Cox, S.P., and Benson, A.J. Unpublished. Roadmap to more sustainable Pacific herring fisheries in Canada: a step-by-step guide to the management strategy evaluation approach. Prepared for Pelagics Resource Management, Fisheries and Oceans Canada Pacific Region.) *

Defining the decision context clarifies the goals of the process and lays out the roadmap for how to achieve the goals[^1]. Key questions to guide definition of the decision context for MSE include:

* What is the the exact decision to be made?

* What is the timeframe for making the decision?

* What are the boundaries on the project and decision?

* What are specific roles and responsibilities of those involved, who may include science, management, First Nations, industry, academia and NGOs? 

* How will the final decision will be made? For example, it may be necessary to rank or weight objectives if there is large conflict in performance against objectives.


### 2. Selection of objectives and performance metrics


### 3. Selection of uncertainties/specification of operating models


### 4. Identification of candidate management procedures


### 5. Simulation of the application of the management procedures


### 6. Presentation of results and selection of a management procedure

Text text text

## HOW THE PROPOSED APPROACH ADOPTS THESE BEST PRACTICES

* Define decision context
    -  give examples throughout including what we propose as starting points

* Define specific objectives and performance indicator
    - suggested starting points for objectives and performance indicators across most stocks this will apply to
    - justify these objectives and performance indicators based on PA framework, literature, and precedent in Canada and elsewhere

* Identify management procedure options
    - summarize candidates that we have narrowed it down to
    - reference the detailed appendix

* Define a set of operating models that capture main uncertainties
    - what are the common main uncertainties that we should make sure to capture
    - what are potential sources of uncertainty that by default we suggest should not be focused on (but could be included on a stock by stock basis)
    - the idea behind robustness sets; example robustness sets
    - consider weights based on relative plausibility (and why by default we suggest avoiding this complexity)

* Simulate and compute performance indicators
    - proposed software (DLMtool)
    	- why use it?
    	- what it can do?
    	- note that the approach is software agnostic
    	- examples of where it has been used
    - how many iterations: checking for convergence of MP selection

* Rank overall MP performance
    - suggested figures and table
    - explain satisficing
    - describe potential default satisficing rules

* Apply the MP to real fishery
    - same MP; real data 
    - reinforce that MP needs to be followed exactly as defined to meet desired objectives
    - if adjustments need to be made this suggests a need to revisit the objectives
