## STOCK SLOT DESCRIPTIONS {#app:desc-stock-shortraker-rockfish}

```{r warnings = FALSE}
stock <- methods::new('Stock')
```

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### Name {#app:desc-stock-name-shortraker-rockfish}

*The name of the Stock object. Single value. Character string*

```{r desc-stock-name-shortraker-rockfish, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
stock@Name <- "Shortraker Rockfish Coastwide Stock"
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### Common_Name {#app:desc-stock-common_name-shortraker-rockfish}

*Common name of the species. Character string*

```{r desc-stock-common_name-shortraker-rockfish, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
stock@Common_Name <- "Shortraker Rockfish"
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### Species {#app:desc-stock-species-shortraker-rockfish}

*Scientific name of the species. Genus and species name. Character string*

```{r desc-stock-species-shortraker-rockfish, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
stock@Species <- "Sebastes borealis"
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### maxage {#app:desc-stock-maxage-shortraker-rockfish}

*The maximum age of individuals that is simulated (there is no plus group ). Single value. Positive integer*

```{r desc-stock-maxage-shortraker-rockfish, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
stock@maxage <- max(d$survey_samples$age, d$commercial_samples$age, na.rm = TRUE)
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### R0 {#app:desc-stock-r0-shortraker-rockfish}

*The magnitude of unfished recruitment. Single value. Positive real number*

The absolute value is meaningless here. Arbitrarily pick a value.

```{r desc-stock-r0-shortraker-rockfish, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
stock@R0 <- 1000
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### M {#app:desc-stock-m-shortraker-rockfish}

*Natural mortality rate. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real number*

@echave2015 estimated natural mortality in the Gulf of Alaska to be 0.03. We could also use the linear regression model from [@hoenig1983], which estimates $\ln(\hat{M})$ as $\ln(\hat{M}) = 1.44 - 0.982 \cdot \ln(t_\mathrm{max})$. If we assume that the maximum age is the oldest age in our samples, `r stock@maxage`, then we can estimate $M$ as

```{r}
exp(1.44 - 0.982 * log(stock@maxage))
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

which corresponds very closely to that used in @echave2015. We will add some uncertainty around this value by allowing for half or double 0.03:

```{r desc-stock-m-shortraker-rockfish, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
stock@M <- c(0.015, 0.06)
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->

stock@Mexp <- c(NA_real_, NA_real_)
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### Msd {#app:desc-stock-msd-shortraker-rockfish}

*Inter-annual variability in natural mortality rate expressed as a coefficient of variation. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Non-negative real numbers*

Setting this to 0 to turn off this functionality for simplicity.

```{r desc-stock-msd-shortraker-rockfish, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
stock@Msd <- c(0, 0)
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### h {#app:desc-stock-h-shortraker-rockfish}

*Steepness of the stock recruit relationship. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Values from 1/5 to 1*

FIXME: maybe there's an assessment in Alaska we could draw on?

Unless there is a shortraker-specific estimate from assessment elsewhere, we can draw on the posterior predictive distribution from @forrest2010. FIXME: do better than eyeballing the plot. Based on that analysis, let's allow for range that encompasses the mean values for the species considered in that meta-analysis with some additional uncertainty:

```{r desc-stock-h-shortraker-rockfish, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
stock@h <- c(0.4, 0.9)
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### SRrel {#app:desc-stock-srrel-shortraker-rockfish}

*Type of stock-recruit relationship. Single value, switch (1) Beverton-Holt (2) Ricker. Integer*

We will choose a Beverton-Holt as has commonly been done for other groundfish assessments... FIXME citations.

```{r desc-stock-srrel-shortraker-rockfish, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
stock@SRrel <- 1L
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### Perr {#app:desc-stock-perr-shortraker-rockfish}

*Process error, the CV of lognormal recruitment deviations. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Non-negative real numbers*

@thorson2014 finds the mean SD of recruitment deviations in log space for Scorpaeniformes to be about 0.78 with a standard deviation of about 0.35.

FIXME: Need to look for data in other assessments of similar rockfish species or of shortraker in other regions.

```{r desc-stock-perr-shortraker-rockfish, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
stock@Perr <- c(0.5, 0.9)
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

*Autocorrelation in recruitment deviations rec(t)=AC*rec(t-1)+(1-AC)*sigma(t). Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Non-negative real numbers*

@thorson2014 finds the mean autocorrelation for Scorpaeniformes to be about 0.44 with a standard deviation of about 0.28.

```{r desc-stock-ac-shortraker-rockfish, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
stock@AC <- c(0.2, 0.6)
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

### Linf {#app:desc-stock-linf-shortraker-rockfish}

*Maximum length. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers*

```{r load-stan, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library("rstan"))
```

```{r fit-vb, echo = knitr_echo, out.width="4in", fig.width=6, warnings = FALSE}

vb_cv <- mvb_summary[,"Std. Error"] / abs(mvb_summary[,"Estimate"])
gfplot::plot_vb(object_all = mvb, col = c("All" = "black"))

We will grab this from our data analysis:

```{r desc-stock-linf-shortraker-rockfish, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
stock@Linf <- c(-2, 2) * mvb_summary[,"Std. Error"][["linf"]] + mvb$pars[["linf"]]
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### K {#app:desc-stock-k-shortraker-rockfish}

*von Bertalanffy growth parameter k. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers*

We will grab this from our data analysis:

```{r desc-stock-k-shortraker-rockfish, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
stock@K <-c(-2, 2) * mvb_summary[,"Std. Error"][["k"]] + mvb$pars[["k"]]
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### t0 {#app:desc-stock-t0-shortraker-rockfish}

*von Bertalanffy theoretical age at length zero. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Non-positive real numbers*

We will grab this from our data analysis:

```{r desc-stock-t0-shortraker-rockfish, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
stock@t0 <- c(-2, 2) *  mvb_summary[,"Std. Error"][["t0"]] + mvb$pars[["t0"]]
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### LenCV {#app:desc-stock-lencv-shortraker-rockfish}

*Coefficient of variation of length-at-age (assumed constant for all age classes). Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers*

We will grab this from our data analysis:

```{r desc-stock-lencv-shortraker-rockfish, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
sd2cv <- function(.sd) sqrt(exp(.sd^2) - 1)
stock@LenCV <- sd2cv(exp(mvb$pars[["log_sigma"]]))
round(stock@LenCV, 2)
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### Ksd {#app:desc-stock-ksd-shortraker-rockfish}

*Inter-annual variability in growth parameter k expressed as coefficient of variation. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Non-negative real numbers*

FIXME: pick this. For now picking an arbitrary range.

```{r desc-stock-ksd-shortraker-rockfish, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
stock@Ksd <- c(0, 0.2)
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### Linfsd {#app:desc-stock-linfsd-shortraker-rockfish}

*Inter-annual variability in maximum length expressed as a coefficient of variation. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Non-negative real numbers*

FIXME: We don't have much to go on here without some kind of a meta-analysis across other species.

```{r desc-stock-linfsd-shortraker-rockfish, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
stock@Linfsd <- c(0, 0.2)
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### L50 {#app:desc-stock-l50-shortraker-rockfish}

*Length at 50 percent maturity. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers*

```{r fit-maturity, echo = knitr_echo, out.width="4in", fig.width=6}
m_mat <- gfplot::fit_mat_ogive(d$survey_samples, type = "length")
mat_perc <- pbs2dlm:::extract_maturity_perc(coef(m_mat$model))
se_l50 <- pbs2dlm:::delta_method(~ -(log((1/0.5) - 1) + x1 + x3) / (x2 + x4),
    mean = coef(m_mat$model), cov = vcov(m_mat$model))
gfplot::plot_mat_ogive(m_mat)
```

From our model, length that 50% maturity for females is calculated as `r round(mat_perc$f.p0.5, 1)` with a standard error of `r round(se_l50, 1)`. Let's pick a range that is roughly the 95% confidence interval around the estimated length that 50% maturity. Length the maturity looks similar for males and females.

```{r desc-stock-l50-shortraker-rockfish, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
stock@L50 <- round(c(-2, 2) * se_l50 + mat_perc$f.p0.5, 1)
stock@L50
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

### L50_95 {#app:desc-stock-l50_95-shortraker-rockfish}

*Length increment from 50 percent to 95 percent maturity. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers*

Similarly we will calculate the increment in length from 50% to 95% maturity.

```{r desc-stock-l50_95-shortraker-rockfish, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
# TODO: Yikes! Need to check this delta method implementation.
se_l50_95m <- pbs2dlm:::delta_method(
  ~ -(log((1/0.95) - 1) + x1 + x3) / (x2 + x4) -
    -(log((1/0.5) - 1) + x1 + x3) / (x2 + x4),
    mean = coef(m_mat$model), cov = vcov(m_mat$model))
stock@L50_95 <- round(c(-2, 2) * se_l50_95m + (mat_perc$f.p0.95 - mat_perc$f.p0.5), 1)
stock@L50_95
```

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### D {#app:desc-stock-d-shortraker-rockfish}

*Current level of stock depletion SSB(current)/SSB(unfished). Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Fraction*

TODO: We are probably going to have to bound some reasonable numbers here unless we can fit a basic model such as a surplus production model or a length-based model. For now picking and wide range.

FIXME: This is an important value that we may want to think more deeply about.

```{r desc-stock-d-shortraker-rockfish, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
stock@D <- c(0.1, 0.8)
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### a {#app:desc-stock-a-shortraker-rockfish}

*Length-weight parameter alpha. Single value. Positive real number*

We can fit a length-weight growth model with gfplot:

```{r fit-lw, echo = knitr_echo, out.width="4in", fig.width=6}
mlw <- gfplot::fit_length_weight(d$survey_samples, sex = "all")

gfplot::plot_length_weight(object_all = mlw, col = c("All" = "black"))
```

We can fill this slot from our fitted model.

```{r desc-stock-a-shortraker-rockfish, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
stock@a <- exp(mlw$pars[["log_a"]])
round(log(stock@a), 2)
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### b {#app:desc-stock-b-shortraker-rockfish}

*Length-weight parameter beta. Single value. Positive real number*

We can take this from our fitted model.

```{r desc-stock-b-shortraker-rockfish, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
stock@b <- mlw$pars[["b"]]
round(stock@b, 2)
```

stock@Frac_area_1 <- c(0.5, 0.5)

### Prob_staying {#app:desc-stock-prob_staying-shortraker-rockfish}

*The probability of inviduals in area 1 remaining in area 1 over the course of one year. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive fraction.*

We will set this to 0.5 to approximate a single area model.

```{r desc-stock-prob_staying-shortraker-rockfish, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
stock@Prob_staying <- c(0.5, 0.5)

<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### Fdisc {#app:desc-stock-fdisc-shortraker-rockfish}

*Fraction of discarded fish that die. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Non-negative real numbers*

We can assume that nearly 100% of the discarded shortraker rockfish die from barotrauma. However, we have assumed no discarding elsewhere in our operating model so this will have no effect.

```{r desc-stock-fdisc-shortraker-rockfish, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}

### nyears {#app:desc-fleet-nyears-shortraker-rockfish}

*The number of years for the historical spool-up simulation. Single value. Positive integer*

We will set the historical run-up to be approximately the length of the commercial fishery. We have catches from 1978.

### Spat_targ {#app:desc-fleet-spat_targ-shortraker-rockfish}

*Distribution of fishing in relation to spatial biomass: fishing distribution is proportional to B^Spat_targ. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Real numbers*

TODO: Need to dig into the code understand this parameter. Perhaps this only comes into play with the multiple areas model?

### EffYears {#app:desc-fleet-effyears-shortraker-rockfish}

*Years representing join-points (vertices) of time-varying effort. Vector. Non-negative real numbers*

TODO: May need to come up with some plausible scenarios for these effort trajectories.

For now, I will derive these as approximations of the effort timeseries from the CPUE standardization analyses. I will use the time series from our "fleet" that is most relevant to catching shortraker. I will also extend a small amount of effort back to the beginning of the historical time, and set the lower and upper limits as 50% above and below the calculated timeseries.

```{r desc-fleet-effyears-shortraker-rockfish, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}

### Esd {#app:desc-fleet-esd-shortraker-rockfish}

*Additional inter-annual variability in fishing mortality rate. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Non-negative real numbers*

TODO: We don't have a lot of data to go on for this. We will use a wide range from very little to moderate interannual variability in fishing mortality rate.

```{r desc-fleet-esd-shortraker-rockfish, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}

### L5 {#app:desc-fleet-l5-shortraker-rockfish}

*Shortest length corresponding to 5 percent vulnerability. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers*

Based on the slot `isRel` below, this lot needs to be filled in proportion of size-of-maturity. The 95% CI of size at maturity from this analysis is `r stock@L50[[1]]` to `r stock@L50[[2]]`. The shortest length fish in the commercial samples is `r min_caught <- min(d$commercial_samples$length, na.rm = TRUE);min_caught`. Presumably much shorter fish could be caught but are not because they are not at locations or depths that would be caught by the gear. That minimum commercial length caught corresponds to between `r round(min_caught/stock@L50[[2]], 1)`- and `r round(min_caught/stock@L50[[1]], 1)`-fold of the length at 50% maturity. Let's take a range a bit wider than that and allow for somewhat smaller fish to possibly be caught. Note that `L5` must be less than `LFS` below.

```{r desc-fleet-l5-shortraker-rockfish, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
fleet@L5 <- c(0.6, 1.0)

### LFS {#app:desc-fleet-lfs-shortraker-rockfish}

### Vmaxlen {#app:desc-fleet-vmaxlen-shortraker-rockfish}

We will set this to 1. Setting this to a value lower than 1 would be assuming dome-shaped selectivity.

### Cobs {#app:desc-obs-cobs-shortraker-rockfish}

*Log-normal catch observation error expressed as a coefficient of variation. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Non-negative real numbers*

At least since 1996, observation error on catch should be very small. Setting this to 0.

TODO: does this affect historical build up because there was certainly much larger observation error on catch before 1996.

```{r desc-obs-cobs-shortraker-rockfish, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}

### Cbiascv {#app:desc-obs-cbiascv-shortraker-rockfish}

*Log-normal coefficient of variation controlling the sampling of bias in catch observations for each simulation. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Non-negative real numbers*

We will keep the at 0 because observation error on catch should be very small with 100% on board and dockside monitoring.

### CAA_nsamp {#app:desc-obs-caa_nsamp-shortraker-rockfish}

*Number of catch-at-age observation per time step. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers*

We will be unlikely to be working with any management procedures that use catch-at-age anyways so this and the following slots are not that important. They will only be used if we also explore some more data-rich management procedures.

TODO: Therefore, for now, I will not adjust these.

### Iobs {#app:desc-obs-iobs-shortraker-rockfish}

*Observation error in the relative abundance indices expressed as a coefficient of variation. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers*

```{r}
average_cv <- dplyr::filter(d$survey_index, survey_abbrev == "SYN WCHG") %>%
  dplyr::pull(re) %>%
  mean() %>%
  round(2)
```

This will depend on whether we want to use one or more of the trawl surveys or commercial CPUE as the index. For now I will assume that we will work with one of the trawl surveys. In that case, the CV on the index is quite large for this species. For example, the best sampling is probably on the West Coast of Haidai Gwaii, and there the average CV is `r average_cv`. Let's use that for now but we could add some uncertainty around this. FIXME

```{r desc-obs-iobs-shortraker-rockfish, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
obs@Iobs <- c(average_cv, average_cv)

### Ibiascv {#app:desc-obs-ibiascv-shortraker-rockfish}

*Log-normal coefficient of variation controlling error in observations of relative abundance index. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers*

TODO: I believe this refers to bias from simulation run to run.

For simplicity we will set this to 0.

### Btobs {#app:desc-obs-btobs-shortraker-rockfish}

*Log-normal coefficient of variation controlling error in observations of current stock biomass among years. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers*

TODO: I'm not sure where this gets used are where we should draw this from. And how is this different from the index lots above? For now I will make it the same at `Iobs`

```{r desc-obs-btobs-shortraker-rockfish, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}

### beta {#app:desc-obs-beta-shortraker-rockfish}

*A parameter controlling hyperstability/hyperdepletion where values below 1 lead to hyperstability (an index that decreases slower than true abundance) and values above 1 lead to hyperdepletion (an index that decreases more rapidly than true abundance). Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers*

We probably don't have a lot to go on here so let's allow for a wide range:

```{r desc-obs-beta-shortraker-rockfish, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}

### LenMbiascv {#app:desc-obs-lenmbiascv-shortraker-rockfish}

*Log-normal coefficient of variation for sampling persistent bias in length at 50 percent maturity. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers*

We don't have a large number of biological samples for the species. It is possible there is some persistent bias in estimates such as length at 50% maturity. Let's set this to a range from a little bit to a moderate amount:

```{r desc-obs-lenmbiascv-shortraker-rockfish, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
obs@LenMbiascv <- c(0.05, 0.10)

### Mbiascv {#app:desc-obs-mbiascv-shortraker-rockfish}

*Log-normal coefficient of variation for sampling persistent bias in observed natural mortality rate. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers*

We don't have good data to go on for natural mortality rate so let's allow for a fairly large range in persistent bias. As a reminder, we set M to be drawn from a uniform distribution between `r stock@M[[1]]` and `r stock@M[[2]]`.

```{r desc-obs-mbiascv-shortraker-rockfish, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}

*Log-normal coefficient of variation for sampling persistent bias in observed growth parameter K. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers*

Again we do not have a large number of biological samples and the aging data has a fair bit of error in it, so let's set this to be arranged from a little bit to quite a bit:

```{r desc-obs-kbiascv-shortraker-rockfish, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
