# REX SOLE CASE STUDY

# BACKGROUND
Rex Sole (*Glyptocephalus zachirus*) occurs from southern California to the
Bering Sea, and is generally distributed throughout coastal British Columbia.
It has been caught in BC at depths between 20 m and greater than 1000 m, 
with most captured between 65 m and 450 m. Rex sole have been caught in BC
waters as large as 58 cm and up to 1.44 kg. The only aged rex sole are those 
caught in the Hecate Strait Multispecies Assemblage Bottom Trawl survey in 1998.
The oldest rex sole aged from BC was a 34 cm female aged at 15 years. Otoliths
have also been collected on surveys from 2000-present which have yet to be aged. 

Rex sole is a commonly caught flatfish species in groundfish bottom trawl
surveys with no directed fishery or currently assigned quota. It has never been 
assessed in BC, but commercial and fishery data are available in DFO databases
for analysis.
