# DLMTOOL OPERATING MODEL {#app:dlmtool-om}

<!-- *A summary of the important features of the DLMtool operating model* -->

<!-- *Draw on appendix of DLMtool paper but simplified to have one region* -->

<!-- *Not too many details; reference the paper* -->

<!-- *TODO: Add references to slot names for user-defined parameters. Need to decide on a consistent method. E.g., do we just put the slot name in parentheses after the parameter or say something specific like "This parameter is  defined under stock@M etc. This is potentially problematic as we are giving the stock and other objects species-specific names (e.g., stock_rex@M). We could just use rex as an example. Or we could go with something generic like stock_speciesname@M* -->

The DLMtool population dynamics operating model (OM) is an age-structured model decribed below. The OM is flexible, with options to allow a number of parameters (e.g., natural mortality, growth, selectivity) to vary through time.
Multiple sub-areas can also be described, and outcome uncertainty can be represented through the addition of implementation uncertainty and bias parameters.
A full range of possible parameterizations is described in the appendices of @carruthers2018.
Here, we present the simplest version of the OM, without time-varying parameters, multiple sub-areas, or implementation bias. 
This OM structure should be suitable as a base OM for most species intended to be assessed with the framework.
More complex structural assumptions, including time-varying parameters, could be developed as scenarios when justified for individual stocks.
Wherever possible, we follow the notation conventions used in the appendices of @carruthers2018 for consistency.

<!-- *TODO: Do we agree on these names for the milestone years??* -->

There are two distinct time-periods in the simulation framework: 
(1) The historical period, which covers the years from the first year of the catch time-series $t_1$ to the final year of the catch time series $t_c$ (where "c" represents "current"); and 
(2) the projection period, which covers the period from the first year after $t_c$ to the final projection year $t_N$. 
The historical period is calibrated to historical observations using an age-structured stock-reduction analysis (SRA) [@kimura1982; @walters2006], described in Appendix \@ref(app:sra).
The closed-loop simulations and calculation of performance metrics begin in year $t_{c+1}$.

Operating model development in the MP Framework when using DLMtool follows three steps:

1. Set parameter values and ranges in the DLMtool OM (OM equations in this appendix; default parameter settings in Appendix \@ref(app:default-slots); examples of user-defined parameter settings in Appendices \@ref(app:desc-om-rex) and \@ref(app:desc-om-sr));

2. Pass the OM parameters to the SRA model (`SRA_scope()` function in MSEtool), which conditions the OM by fiting an age-structured SRA to historical observed catches and indices of abundance (and to age- and length-composition data if available). 
This results in calibrated estimates of model parameters, and estimates of historical biomass and historical fishing mortality that are consistent with historical observations. 
Equations for the SRA model are provided in Appendix \@ref(app:sra); then

3. Pass the calibrated parameter values back to the DLMtool OM (now the "conditioned" OM) for use in the closed-loop simulation projections.

## POPULATION DYNAMICS MODEL  {#sec:dlmtool-pop-dynamics}

Parameters for the population dynamics are included in the `Stock` object of DLMtool.

### Growth and maturity

The operating model assumes that growth follows a von Bertalanffy model:

\begin{equation}
L_{y,a} = L_{\infty}\left( 1 - \exp( - \kappa(a - a_{0} \right))
(\#eq:dlm-om-vonb)
\end{equation}

where $\kappa$ represents the growth rate, $L_{\infty}$ represents the maximum length and $a_0$ represents the theoretical age where length is zero.

Weight-at-age ($W_a$) is  assumed to be related to length-at-age ($L_a$) by:

\begin{equation}
W_{y,a} = \beta_{W}\ {L_{a}}^{\alpha_{W}}.
(\#eq:dlm-om-wta)
\end{equation}

Maturity is specified according to length, using a logistic model with parameters describing length-at-50% maturity ($\theta_{l50}$) and the length increment to 95% maturity ($\theta_{l50-95}$). Maturity ($m$) at length ($l$) is then calculated as:

<!-- TODO: I might've messed this up in my interpretation of Delta l50, which is now been removed! Check this! -->

\begin{equation}
m_{l} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{{- \ln}19\left( \frac{l - \theta_{l50}}{{{\theta}}_{l50-95}} \right)}},
(\#eq:dlm-om-matl)
\end{equation}

where and maturity ($m$) at age ($a$) is calculated using the length-at-age:

\begin{equation}
m_{a} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{{- \ln}19\left( \frac{a - \theta_{a50}}{\theta_{a95} - \theta_{a50}} \right)}}
(\#eq:dlm-om-mata)
\end{equation}

where \(\theta_{a50}\) and \(\theta_{a95}\) represent the age at 50% and 95% maturity given by the inverse von-Bertalanffy growth curve:

<!-- TODO: check these! -->
\begin{equation}
\theta_{a50} = \frac{- \ln\left( 1 - \theta_{l50} / L_{\infty} \right)}{\kappa} + t_{0}
(\#eq:dlm-om-invonb)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\theta_{a95} = \frac{- \ln\left( 1 - \left( \theta_{l50} / L_{\infty} + {{\theta}}_{l50\_ 95} / L_{\infty} \right) \right)}{\kappa} + t_{0}
(\#eq:dlm-om-theta95)
\end{equation}

### Population dynamics

Leading parameters of the population dynamics model, defined as fixed values or ranges by the user, are: unfished recruitment \({{R}}_{0}\), the steepness parameter of the stock-recruit relationship ($h$) [@mace1988], and natural mortality ($M$). 

Recruitmment and numbers-at-age are initialized in the first historical year using the SRA model (Appendix \@ref(app:sra), Equations \@ref(eq:dlm-sra-numinit) and \@ref(eq:dlm-sra-recinit)).

During the projection period (years $y$ = $t_{c+1}$ to $y$ = $t_N$), the number of fish recruited to the first age group in each year $N_{y,a=1}$
is calculated as a function of last year's spawning biomass \(S_{y-1}\), assuming a Beverton-Holt stock-recruit relationship with annual
lognormal recruitment deviations $\varepsilon_{R,y-1}$:

\begin{equation}
N_{y, a = 1} = \left( \frac{4 {h} R_{0} S_{y-1}} {S_{0}  \left( 1 - {h} \right) + \left( 5{h} - 1 \right) S_{y-1}} \right) \cdot \varepsilon_{R,y-1},
(\#eq:dlm-om-recy)
\end{equation}

where unfished spawning biomass \(S_{0}\) is calculated as the
sum over ages of the maturity at age $m_a$, weight-at-age
$W_a$, and unfished numbers at age  \({{\ {R}}_{0}\ e^{\sum_{i = 1}^{a}M_{i}}}\):

\begin{equation}
S_{0} = \sum_{a = 1}^{n_{a}}{m_{a}\ W_{a}{\ {R}}_{0}\ e^{\sum_{i = 1}^{a}M_{i}}}.
(\#eq:dlm-om-so)
\end{equation}

and spawning biomass $S_{y}$ in a given year is the
sum over ages of the maturity-at-age $m_a$, the weight-at-age
$W_a$, and numbers at age $N_{y,a}$:

\begin{equation}
S_{y} = \sum_{a = 1}^{n_{a}}{m_{a}W_{a}N_{y,a}}.
(\#eq:dlm-om-sy)
\end{equation}

Annual recruitment deviations ($\varepsilon_{R,y}$) are generated by first sampling from a lognormal distribution with mean $1$ and standard deviation \({{\sigma}}_{R}\):

\begin{equation}
\varepsilon_{R,y}\sim \mathrm{Lognormal}\left( 1,{{\sigma}}_{R} \right),
(\#eq:dlm-om-recdev)
\end{equation}

Temporal autocorrelation \({{\theta}}_{\textrm{AC}}\) is added to these initial draws ($\varepsilon_{R,y}$) as:

\begin{equation}
\varepsilon_{R,y} = {{\theta}}_{\textrm{AC}}\varepsilon_{R,y - 1} + \varepsilon_{R,y}\sqrt{\left( 1 - {{{\theta}}_{\textrm{AC}}}^{2} \right)},
(\#eq:dlm-om-auto)
\end{equation}

where $\theta_{\mathrm{AC}}$ represents a first-order autocorrelation term, and setting \({{\theta}}_{\textrm{AC}}\) to zero implies no autocorrelation.

The number of fish $N$ in each year $y$ > $t_c$ and age $a$ > 1 is then calculated from the numbers in the previous year and age class,
subject to the instantaneous total mortality rate ($Z$) at age ($a$):

\begin{equation}
N_{y + 1,a + 1} = N_{a}e^{- Z_{a}} 
(\#eq:dlm-om-numa)
\end{equation}

where the total mortality rate $Z_{y,a}$ is the sum of the instantaneous rates of natural mortality ($M$), assumed constant across years and ages unless otherwise specified, and fishing mortality-at-age ($F_{y,a}$, defined in Equation \@ref(eq:dlm-om-Fay)):

\begin{equation}
Z_{y,a} = M + F_{y,a}.
(\#eq:dlm-om-z)
\end{equation}

## FISHING DYNAMICS {#sec:dlmtool-fishing-dynamics}
Parameters for the fleet dynamics are included in the `Fleet` object of DLMtool.
During the projection period, the rate of fishing mortality-at-age ($F_{y,a}$) is calculated from the TAC prescribed by the MP ($\textrm{TAC}_{\mathrm{MP},y}$).
To distribute catches over ages it is first necessary to calculate the distribution of vulnerable biomass across ages ($V_{y,a}$):

\begin{equation}
V_{y,a} = N_{y,a} W_{a} s_{a} R_{a}
(\#eq:dlm-om-vulcom)
\end{equation}

where the vulnerability-at-age  $s_{y,a}$ is calculated from a double-normal selectivity curve and length-at-age:

\begin{equation}
s_{y,a} = \left\{ \begin{matrix} 
2^{- \ \frac{{(L_{y,a} - {{L}}_{\textrm{smax}})}^{2}}{\sigma_{\textrm{sasc}}^{2}}} & L_{y,a} \leq {{L}}_{\textrm{smax}} \\ 
2^{- \ \frac{{(L_{y,a} - {{L}}_{\textrm{smax}})}^{2}}{\sigma_{\textrm{sdesc}}^{2}}} & L_{y,a} > {{L}}_{\textrm{smax}} \\ 
\end{matrix} \right.\ 
(\#eq:dlm-om-say)
\end{equation}

<!-- The length at maximum selectivity \(L_{\textrm{smax}}\) is user-defined.  -->
The standard deviation parameters of the ascending limb are given by the length at 5% vulnerability \({L}_{5}\):

\begin{equation}
\sigma_{\textrm{sasc}}^{2} = \frac{{{L}}_{5} - {{L}}_{\textrm{smax}}}{\sqrt{- \log_{2^{0.05}}}}
(\#eq:dlm-om-siglasc)
\end{equation}

While the standard deviation of the descending limb is given by the vulnerability \({V}_{\overline{L}} \) of fish of length \(\overline{L}\):

\begin{equation}
\sigma_{\textrm{sdesc}}^{2} = \frac{\overline{L} - {{L}}_{\textrm{smax}}}{\sqrt{- \log_{2^{{{V}}_{\overline{L}}}}}}
(\#eq:dlm-om-sigldes)
\end{equation}

The realized projected catches $C_{y,a}$ are the TAC recommendations across ages. 
Projected catches may account for retention rate ($R_{y,a}$) and post-release discard mortality rate $\theta_{M{\textrm{disc}}}$ in the presence of discarding.
Implementation uncertainty ($I_\textrm{TAC}$, Equation \@ref(eq:dlm-om-itac)) may also be accounted for, e.g., in the presence of consistent under-utilization of TACs. 

\begin{equation}
C_{y,a} = \frac{V_{y,a}} {\sum_{a}^{n_{a}}V_{y,a}}
\textrm{TAC}_{\mathrm{MP},y}\ I_{\mathrm{TAC},y}\
\frac{R_{y,a} + \left( 1 - R_{a} \right)
{{\theta}}_{\textrm{Mdisc}}}{R_{a}}
(\#eq:dlm-om-cata)
\end{equation}

where ($I_\textrm{TAC}$) is user-defined, and the overall retention rate-at-age $R_a$, is a combination of an age-specific retention $r_a$ with a maximum value of $1$ (Equation **TODO**), and a constant rate of discarding \(\gamma\):

\begin{equation}
R_{a} = r_{a}\ (1 - \gamma).
(\#eq:dlm-om-retention)
\end{equation}

where age-specific retention $r_{y,a}$, is modelled using the same form of double-normal curve as selectivity:

\begin{equation}
r_{y,a} = \left\{ \begin{matrix} 
2^{- \ \frac{{(L_{y,a} - {{L}}_{\textrm{rmax}})}^{2}}{\sigma_{\textrm{rasc}}^{2}}} & L_{y,a} \leq {{L}}_{\textrm{rmax}} \\ 
2^{- \ \frac{{(L_{y,a} - {{L}}_{\textrm{rmax}})}^{2}}{\sigma_{\textrm{rdesc}}^{2}}} & L_{y,a} > {{L}}_{\textrm{rmax}} \\ 
\end{matrix} \right.\ 
(\#eq:dlm-om-ray)
\end{equation}

The length at maximum retention \({L}_{\textrm{rmax}}\) is
user-specified. The standard deviation parameters of the
ascending limb is given by user-specified length at 5% retention
\({r}_{5}\):

\begin{equation}
\sigma_{\textrm{rasc}}^{2} = \frac{{{r}}_{5} - {L}_{\textrm{rmax}}}{\sqrt{- \log_{2^{0.05}}}}
(\#eq:dlm-om-sigrasc)
\end{equation}

While the standard deviation of the descending limb is given by
user-specified retention \({{r}}_{\overline{L}} \) of fish of
length \(\overline{L}\):

\begin{equation}
\sigma_{\textrm{rdesc}}^{2} = \frac{\overline{L} - {{L}}_{\textrm{rmax}}}{\sqrt{- \log_{2^{{{r}}_{\overline{L}}}}}}
(\#eq:dlm-om-sigrdec)
\end{equation}

Fishing mortality rates are then calculated from the realized catches $C_{y,a}$
subject to the constraint that they do not exceed user-specified
${F_\textrm{max}}$:

\begin{equation}
F_{y,a} = \min \left( - \ln\left( 1 - \frac{C_{y,a}}{N_{y,a}{W}_{a}} \right),F_{\max} \right).
(\#eq:dlm-om-Fay)
\end{equation}


## OBSERVATION DYNAMICS

Parameters for observation dynamics are included in the `Obs` object of DLMtool.
The observation dynamics emulate the collection of data for use in the MPs.
Three fundamental types of data are simulated by the OM: (1) time series data (e.g. annual
catches from 1970-2017); (2) catch composition data (e.g., length or age samples); and (3) single-value variables and parameters (e.g., bias parameters to simulate consistent underestimation of natural mortality rate or steepness of the stock-recruitment relationship).

### Time series data

Time series data are simulated with various types of error that would be expected from real-life sampling of fisheries data (e.g., lognormal observation error in indices of abundance). 

<!-- TODO: RF checking with AH that the index equations are correct. I adapted them from the catch series equations in @carruthers2018 Appendix E, given we are not adding obs error to the catch data, it seemed more appropriate to explicitly explain how indices are generated. Note this is quite different from what we discussed with Quang this week, where the sigma comes from the fit to the SRA -->

Annual observed indices of abundance are calculated by adding observation error and bias to annual relative spawning biomass ($S_{y}$;  Equation \@ref(eq:dlm-om-sy)) through a
factor term $\omega_{C,y}$ that includes bias and imprecision in the index observations:

\begin{equation}
I_{y}^{\text{obs}} = \omega_{I,y}\frac{{S_{y}}^{\beta}}{\frac{1}{y}\sum_{i = 1}^{y}{S_{i}}^{\beta}}
(\#eq:dlm-om-iy)
\end{equation}

where $\beta$ is the hyperstability-hyperdepletion parameter. When $\beta$ is 1
the index is linearly related to spawning biomass $S_y$. When $\beta$ is
greater than 1 the index is hyper deplete and moves faster than true
spawning biomass changes. When $\beta$ is lower than 1 the index is
hyperstable and moves slower than true spawning biomass changes. Note
that in every year $y$ that the index is recalculated, it is
re-normalised to have a mean value of 1 over all years.

The index factor $\omega_{I,y}$ includes both bias ${\widetilde{b}}_{I}$
and imprecision ${\widetilde{\sigma}}_{I}$ in observations.

\begin{equation}
\omega_{I,y} = {\widetilde{b}}_{I}\text{\ exp}\left( \varepsilon_{I,y} - \frac{{\widetilde{\sigma}}_{I}}{2} \right)
(\#eq:dlm-om-omegai)
\end{equation}

where bias ${\widetilde{b}}_{I}$ is an improper fraction (e.g.
${\widetilde{b}}_{I}$ = 1.2 is equivalent to a 20% positive bias) and
the lognormal error term $\epsilon$, is drawn from a standard normal
distribution whose standard deviation ${\widetilde{\sigma}}_{I}$ is
sampled at random in each simulation:

\begin{equation}
\varepsilon_{I,y}\sim N\left( 0,{\widetilde{\sigma}}_{I} \right)
(\#eq:dlm-om-epsiloni)
\end{equation}

By default DLMtool samples simulation-specific observation error
${\widetilde{\sigma}}_{I}$ from a uniform distribution.

\begin{equation}
{\widetilde{\sigma}}_{I}\sim U\left( \text{LB}_{I},\text{UB}_{I} \right)
(\#eq:dlm-om-sigi)
\end{equation}

and bias ${\widetilde{b}}_{I}$ from a log-normal distribution:

\begin{equation}
{\widetilde{b}}_{I} = \ exp\left( \varepsilon_{\text{bI}} - \frac{\sigma_{\text{bI}}}{2} \right)
(\#eq:dlm-om-biasi)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\varepsilon_{\text{bI}}\sim N\left( 0,\sigma_{\text{bI}} \right)
(\#eq:dlm-om-epsilonbi)
\end{equation}

<!--
This convention means that the user can specify an unbiased (e.g. low
$\sigma_{\text{bC}}$ and therefore sampled values of
${\widetilde{b}}_{I}$ close to 1) or a biased (e.g. high
$\sigma_{\text{bC}}$ and therefore sampled values of
${\widetilde{b}}_{I}$ substantially lower or higher than 1) time series
that can be observed with a low degree of error (e.g. low sampled values
of ${\widetilde{\sigma}}_{I}$ specified by lower *LB~I~* and *UB~I~*) or
high degree of error (e.g. high sampled values of
${\widetilde{\sigma}}_{I}$ specified by higher *LB~I~* and *UB~I~*).
Table App E.1. details all time series data that are simulated, their
biases and observation errors using the $\sigma_{b}$ (parameter
controlling extent of bias) and *LB~I~* and *UB~I~* (range of
observation error) conventions described here.

Other time series data are simulated in the same way (Table App.E.1).
These include estimates of absolute biomass calculated from annual
vulnerable biomass *V* (Eqn 30)
($\sigma_{\text{bB}}\ {,\widetilde{b}}_{B}$, ${\widetilde{\sigma}}_{B}$,
*LB~B~* and *UB~B~*),stock depletion calculated from spawning biomass
relative to unfished levels (Eqn 27)
($\sigma_{\text{bD}}\ {,\widetilde{b}}_{D}$, ${\widetilde{\sigma}}_{D}$,
*LB~D~* and *UB~D~*), annual total fishing mortality rate calculated in
Eqns 25, 40 and 41 ($\sigma_{\text{bF}}\ {,\widetilde{b}}_{F}$,
${\widetilde{\sigma}}_{F}$, *LB~F~* and *UB~F~*), and relative abundance
indices calculated from time series of spawning biomass *S* (Eqn 15)
($\sigma_{\text{bI}}\ {,\widetilde{b}}_{I}$, ${\widetilde{\sigma}}_{I}$,
*LB~I~* and *UB~I~*). The last of these differs because it is simulated
with an additional parameter controlling non-linearity in the
relationship between spawning biomass and the index:

55)
$I_{y}^{\text{obs}} = \omega_{I,y}\frac{{S_{y}}^{\text{beta}}}{\frac{1}{y}\sum_{i = 1}^{y}{S_{i}}^{\text{beta}}}$

where $\omega_{I,y}$ is the index factor that, like annual catches (Eqns
49 - 54 ) includes bias and imprecision in the index observations and
*beta* is the hyperstability-hyperdepletion parameter. When *beta* is 1
the index is linearly related to spawning biomass *S*. When *beta* is
greater than 1 the index is hyper deplete and moves faster than true
spawning biomass changes. When *beta* is lower than 1 the index is
hyperstable and moves slower than true spawning biomass changes. Note
that in every year *y* that the index is recalculated, it is
re-normalised to have a mean value of 1 over all years.

***Single value variables and parameters***

Unlike time-series data, single value variables and parameters are
assumed to have a fixed bias over the entire projected time series. For
example, growth rate *κ* may be consistently over or under-estimated:

56)
$\kappa^{\text{obs}} = {\widetilde{b}}_{\kappa}\ \widetilde{\kappa}\ $

57)
${\widetilde{b}}_{\kappa} = \ exp\left( \varepsilon_{\text{bκ}} - \frac{\sigma_{\text{bκ}}}{2} \right)$

58\) $\ \varepsilon_{\text{bκ}}\sim N\left( 0,\sigma_{\text{bκ}} \right)$

A number of slots in the *Obs* object control consistent biases in
observed quantities that are described in further detail in Table
App.E.2.

***Catch composition data***

Two types of catch composition observations are simulated, catches by
age class by year (CAA) and catches by length class by year (CAL).

These observation models use a simple multinomial model that accounts
for effective sample size (the number of independent observations). For
both CAA and CAL observation models the user specifies an average annual
number of samples (number of individuals measured for example) and the
annual effective sample size. For example, *ESS~CAA~* independent catch
samples at age (e.g. 20 per year) are sampled in proportion *p* to the
spatial catch-at-age predicted by the model *C* (Eqns. 37 and 39):

59)
${\dot{C}}_{y,a}^{\text{obs}}\sim multinomial\left( \text{ESS}_{\text{CAA}},p_{a} = \ \sum_{r}^{n_{r}}C_{y,a,r} \right)$

For each year, the frequency of samples at age are inflated to match the
total sample size *n~CAA~* and rounded to the nearest integer:

60)
$C_{y,a}^{\text{obs}} = nint\left( \ \frac{{\dot{C}}_{y,a}^{\text{obs}}\ n_{\text{CAA}}}{\text{ESS}_{\text{CAA}}} \right)$

Due to rounding, this relatively simple model generates frequency at age
data that is approximately equal to (but not always exactly) the average
annual sample size:

61\) $\sum_{a}^{n_{a}}{C_{y,a}^{\text{obs}}\ } \approx n_{\text{CAA}}$

For example, for 10 age classes, *n~CAA~* = 200 and *n~ESS~* = 45, 90%
of simulations sampled $\sum_{a}^{n_{a}}{C_{y,a}^{\text{obs}}\ }$equal
to 199, 200 or 201 and less than 1% of simulation were less than 198 or
greater than 202.

## IMPLEMENTATION DYNAMICS

Parameters for implementation dynamics are included in the `Imp` object of DLMtool.
DLMtool includes three types of implementation error, which relate to MPs that provide management advice in terms of Total Allowable Catch (TAC), Total Allowable Effort (TAE) and size limits (SL). 
This Framework only considers MPs that provide TAC advice for its quota-managed groundfish fishery.
Given that BC groundfish fisheries are subject to 100% at-sea and dockside observer coverage, we make the assumption that under-reporting of TACs is negligible. 
However, for non-target species, there is a possibility that TACs will not be fully-utilized. 
The implementation uncertainty in TACs is applied in Equation \@ref(eq:dlm-om-cata). 

The TAC implementation uncertainty term ($I_\textrm{TAC}$) is the product of a constant fraction of the TAC taken ${\widetilde{b}}_{\text{TAC}}$ and a degree of inter-annual
variability controlled by ${\widetilde{\sigma}}_{\text{TAC}}$.


\begin{equation}
I_{TAC,y} = {\widetilde{b}}_{\text{TAC}}\text{\ exp}\left( \varepsilon_{TAC,y} - \frac{{\widetilde{\sigma}}_{\text{TAC}}}{2} \right)
(\#eq:dlm-om-itac)
\end{equation}


where ${\widetilde{b}}_{\text{TAC}}$ is an improper fraction (e.g.
${\widetilde{b}}_{\text{TAC}}$ = 0.7 is equivalent to 30% catch
underages) and the lognormal error term $\varepsilon_{TAC,y}$, is drawn from a standard
normal distribution whose standard deviation
${\widetilde{\sigma}}_{\text{TAC}}$ was sampled at random in each
simulation:

\begin{equation}
\varepsilon_{TAC,y}\sim N\left( 0,{\widetilde{\sigma}}_{\text{TAC}} \right)
(\#eq:dlm-om-epsilontac)
\end{equation}

By default DLMtool samples simulation-specific variability
${\widetilde{\sigma}}_{\text{TAC}}$ from a uniform distribution.

\begin{equation}
{\widetilde{\sigma}}_{\text{TAC}}\sim U\left( \text{LB}_{\text{TAC}},\text{UB}_{\text{TAC}} \right)
(\#eq:dlm-om-sigmatac)
\end{equation}

and mean fraction of recommendation ${\widetilde{b}}_{\text{TAC}}$ from
a log-normal distribution:

\begin{equation}
{\widetilde{b}}_{\text{TAC}} = \ exp\left( \varepsilon_{\text{bTAC}} - \frac{\sigma_{\text{bTAC}}}{2} \right)
(\#eq:dlm-om-btac)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\varepsilon_{\text{bTAC}}\sim N\left( 0,\sigma_{\text{bTAC}} \right)
(\#eq:dlm-om-epsilonbtac)
\end{equation}

## CALCULATION OF REFERENCE POINTS
