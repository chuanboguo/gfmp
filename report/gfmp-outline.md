## Introduction (existing draft)

### Motivation

### The tiered approach

### Movement towards management procedure approaches

### the model-oriented approach versus the management-oriented approach (not yet drafted)

- see herring MSE roadmap for example

### The objectives of this project

### The expected benefits of this project

## Candidate management procedures

### How we picked them

### Document them

### Give examples of where they have been used

## DLMtool

### Why using it

### Note that the approach is software agnostic

### What it can do

### Examples of where it has been used

## Best practices for setting up a management procedure approach from the literature (draw on Punt et al. 2016 and/or Rob's work and/or herring roadmap?)

### Briefly list suggested steps, for example (from herring roadmap)

### define decision context

### define specific objectives and performance indicators

### identify management procedure options

### define a set of operating models that capture main uncertainties, consider weights based on relative plausibility

### simulate and compute performance indicators

### rank overall mp performance

### apply the mp to real fishery

## How the proposed approach goes about adopting those best practices

### likely a meaty section

### The importance of staying the course with the management procedure

- MP needs to be followed exactly as defined to meet desired objectives

## Implicit versus explicit knowledge of limit reference points

### how this can still fit into the precautionary framework, sustainable fisheries framework and bill C68

### not just a backup solution, could be argued that this is a better solution then the usual explicit knowledge

## Summarize the case studies

## Suggested format of the advice

### Suggested elements to include in a research document

### Suggested elements to include in a SAR

### Potential use of SRs to update advice

### Potential to assess multiple related species simultaneously

## Suggestions for reassessment frequency

## Suggestions for establishing triggers for reassessment

### Identifying mismatches between the operating model and realized data

## Suggestions for including environmental effects

### tie into bill C68

### Perhaps one of the most feasible ways to include environmental effects is via operating models

## Suggestions for using the approach to determine the value of information

### possibly draw on the value of aging data for English sole from a case study as an example

## Suggestions for use in rebuilding plans

### Brief overview

### Note the upcoming yelloweye inside application

## Appendix 1: Case study towards more data rich/moderate spectrum (English sole?)

## Appendix 2: Case study towards the more data limited spectrum (shortraker rockfish)
